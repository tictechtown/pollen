            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several years ago, I published a critique of <a href="https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0">manager READMEs</a> that succeeded in stirring up a lot of feelings, pro and con. I’d like to believe it prompted some people to reconsider whether these are actually effective tools.</p><p>Today, I want to revisit this. Not to encourage you to write a manager README, but to suggest other ways forward that I have learned in the years since writing the first post.</p><figure><img alt="readme" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/225/0*8URkz_l2YKxEqADi" /></figure><h3>The Problem</h3><p>When you become a senior manager or an executive, you face new challenges. Your job involves directing work across many people with different approaches, styles, and opinions. Left to their own devices, each person will develop a slightly different way of communicating with you, one that works for them and that they believe works for you.</p><p>With a broad scope of work to oversee, you need to quickly grasp what matters and should be shared upward, outward, and down into different parts of your organization. Now, at most companies, this is a known problem and inevitably someone has already tried to solve it by means of standardized tooling and reporting. Everyone uses Jira for a reason and it’s not that Jira is the best tool ever, but it is malleable to many types of standardization. Companies implement OKR tools and Tableau dashboards, they institute various program management processes, they run quarterly business reviews, and all of these are done in the name of standardizing the information that is passed upward and outward so that people can make better decisions.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is typically the lowest common denominator of usefulness to any senior manager. Reporting generated in this way obscures as much as it reveals, and it rarely addresses the things that you really care about¹. So senior managers need other mechanisms for imparting what they want to hear about and see. The README can sometimes be an attempt to impart that cultural overlay: a way of saying, “I care about X, and want you to focus on that when you communicate to me; I don’t care much about Y and Z, and by the way, it’s best if you communicate with me in these ways.”</p><p>I remain steadfast that this is not a good approach. It creates a focus on you as the person to be managed up to. Your personality must be accommodated, your preferences honored. I get the desire for this, and I’m certainly not immune to being managed up to, but my preference is to avoid major blind spots. I want to hear what I care about, yes, but I don’t want to live in an information bubble either.</p><p>READMEs are also rather lazy. There’s a kernel of truth in their purpose: we want people to focus certain types of communication on what we believe is most valuable. However, doing it in the form of a general README isn’t actually the most effective approach.</p><p>So if not READMEs, what then?</p><h4>The Solution: Appropriate Templates and Ceremonies</h4><p>Instead of one doc that attempts to communicate all of your preferences and warts and creates a you-focused mindset, it’s time to level up and recognize that a big part of the job of senior/executive management is setting standards for doing certain types of work. The best way to set those standards, in my experience, is lightweight templates and ceremonies for information sharing, discussion, and decision-making.</p><p>I think that every good senior manager should have some toolkit of these. You aren’t just going to operate against the lowest common denominator of pre-existing reports and processes in your company, you have to establish a few processes that exist to show what you care about and where you want the organization to focus. One of mine is Wins and Challenges (discussed in my <a href="https://amzn.to/3MwcgGo">recent book</a>), which I’ve brought from startups to giant teams and everything in-between. Is it extra work on top of whatever people might be doing in Jira or other tools? Possibly. Does it create far more valuable conversation across my leadership team than those tools? Yes. Does it help me specifically understand things and do my job better? Absolutely.</p><p>There is a very lightweight template to follow for my Wins and Challenges, and the process details are owned by the team gathering the information (although I specify opinions about how it should be done, I only check the outcomes). I find that the best templates and processes are lightweight in a way that they show what information should be collected but don’t dictate exactly the process to collect that information.</p><p>Developing templates that expose the right useful information is hard. You will both over-do and under-do this as you’re figuring it out, whether it’s your first time in the job, you’ve moved to a different company or team, or your team has just evolved past the usefulness of the old methods. My advice is to start simple and add on new details or processes only when it’s clear you have a widespread gap. A good rhythm for a new job/team is to learn for 90 days, then introduce what you need, and evolve from there with enough time to learn from each iteration (usually, 1-2 quarters).</p><h4>Don’t Try To Template/Processify Everything</h4><p>I recently asked an experienced CPO about good product processes, and what they looked like from his perspective. One piece of advice was that not everything should have a fixed process or template. When you need to leave room for discussion, it’s often best to limit the structure; a walkthrough of a prototype might be better done as an open-ended exploration and discussion rather than a formal set of steps.</p><p>It’s important not to give into the temptation (or external pressure) to create processes for everything. I personally do not have a fixed format for my 1-1s, and dislike even the expectation of coming with a set of written and shared topics. I don’t want to feel rushed to finish everything on an agenda, and the temptation to immediately jump to conclusions about a topic based on an agenda item often increases miscommunication. Sometimes there’s a need to pre-read and prepare, but sometimes we just need to talk and see where the exploration of current top-of-mind concerns and information takes us.</p><p>So, senior leaders, you can tell people how you want them to work with you, but don’t do it via the crude mechanism of a manager README. Drive clarity through templates and processes where needed, resist the urge to create them everywhere, and lead your organization by showing them where to spend their time and focus as a collective good, not just good for you.</p><p>¹ Think of it this way, if you could easily see the problems via the pre-existing dashboards, they’d already be on their way to being solved. Dashboards are like alerts and tests in this way, they tend to catch what you know could go wrong, but rarely the surprise problems that lead to big incidents. Necessary, but insufficient.</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m working on a talk about rewriting platforms for <a href="https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda/">LDX3</a> later this month. Spoiler alert: a lot of the talk centers around why rewriting platforms is almost always a very bad idea. For more on that you can read the rearchitecting platforms chapter of my <a href="https://amzn.to/3MwcgGo">latest book</a>.</p><p>One of the points we make in the book is that, generally speaking, platform teams are not the foci of innovation at companies. Platform innovations often come either by adopting external innovations, or absorbing and expanding platform-like work that was created by internal application engineering teams for their own purposes. I won’t say that it’s impossible for platform teams to innovate, but a lot of the innovation is much more incremental and evolutionary rather than novel and revolutionary.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean that there’s no need for strategy in your platform team; on the contrary, platform teams are often the fulcrum that drives important architectural evolution across companies. Pretty much every major change in technology that I have lived through has needed platform-level support: containerization, microservices, event-driven systems, big data, continuous delivery, observability, the cloud, elastic scaling. Many build on one another through the platform, such as containerization making it easier to move to the cloud and moving to the cloud making elastic scaling more realistic.</p><p>This is what strategy starts to look like as a platform leader. You’re watching where the state of the art is going, and thinking about what makes sense to introduce or evolve so that you can take advantage of that over time. You’re not forcing everyone to move from bare metal hardware to kubernetes overnight, but you’re making the tools to support bare metal to virtualization/containers available, easy to use, and cost-effective, to encourage the natural evolution to happen. The larger the company, the longer these timelines will run, and the more that you’re going to have a number of leading and lagging strategies running, but this is the engine of baseline modernization that needs constant feeding to keep your technology stack from stagnating.</p><p>“Strategy” and “Vision” are so often conflated in peoples’ minds that this kind of boring but reliable forward progress is overlooked as strategic. But when leaders can execute in this way over years, the application/product teams have that much more flexibility and power to innovate and do interesting things without having to completely go out on their own. So, platform leaders, don’t feel bad if you’re not at the forefront of innovation! You don’t have to drive the next innovation to be strategic, you just need to make it easy for others to get there.</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Hey, I could be wrong!</h4><p>People love to ask me what I think is going to change about engineering management and technology careers given the current AI innovation boom. I am flattered to be asked, but I am not sure I have a good answer. Things keep changing so much in the space, both from real innovations (like Claude Code) and promises of near-miracles (like 90% of all code being written by AI sometime this year), it’s hard to keep up or know what’s true. So, while I have some direct experience, and I continue to collect a lot of interesting anecdotes, I think we’re still in the realm of “futurism” when trying to guess what will happen.</p><p>So, with that out of the way, here is one of my current best guesses. This is not based much on the current state of innovation, except to take as a given that AI is proving to be measurably supportive of building software. It&#39;s instead based on my understanding of economics, human nature, and the skills of people working in tech.</p><h3>So long as there are software engineers, there will still be a range of junior — mid — senior engineers.</h3><p>Some people say that AI will get rid of the need for “junior” engineers, generally taken to mean “people with some training but no full-time software engineering work experience.” Others say that AI will get rid of the middle-tier engineers, those with a few years of experience but who aren’t yet senior. And there’s probably some who think they make even very talented senior engineers obsolete, but more who just really want them to make very talented senior engineers cheaper to hire. But will either of these come to pass?</p><h4>Mostly Junior?</h4><p>It’s clear that AI has been a massive accelerator of what has been called “low-code” or even “no-code.” I know of startups that are hiring nothing but junior people to act as prompt coders, with the senior experienced tech founders overseeing. But these are very early-stage companies, with greenfield codebases. Clearly AI is making it much easier and cheaper for them to get started, and you can now build some types of software early-stage businesses without mid-career engineers. But are you going to keep these “junior” engineers junior forever? Churn them out and hire new ones the minute they develop the context understanding of your business that makes them a) more productive and b) want more money/promotion?</p><p>If you believe “junior engineer” is now in a category other than “knowledge work”, one that has a workforce that can be staffed with a lot people who need minimal training to do the job and far fewer above them to oversee the work, maybe this is true. But it doesn’t sound like we’re at the cusp of turning this job into a largely lower-skill position yet. I’d sooner believe that prompt/vibe coding becomes a skill that other knowledge workers need to have and we just have much smaller engineering teams overall than engineering shifts to primarily juniorization.</p><h4>Mostly Senior?</h4><p>Others say this means you don’t need junior engineers. By most accounts I’ve heard, AI coding tools are making a huge difference in productivity of senior engineers, which naturally slows down the demand for hiring at all. And it’s tempting to delay hiring of junior engineers, the ones that you have to invest in before they become productive, in order to take full advantage of that AI boost for the existing employees. But over time, if the jobs continue to exist, we need new entrants to our talent pool to replace leavers. Not to mention all of the other positive effects bringing new talent into a team creates. <a href="https://medium.com/@skamille/the-senior-shortcut-fadffe5503fd">I’ve written about this already, and I stand my ground</a>: if you think you will continue to need to hire engineers into the future, you should really keep hiring junior ones.</p><h4>What about engineers in-between “Junior” and “Senior”?</h4><p>So long as there are junior engineers, and senior engineers, there will be career paths with midpoint levels. The description of skills might change, the compensation potential might change, the total employment might change, but I am skeptical that one role will disappear but the other two will remain. The only alternate future I can imagine is one where you may start people as a junior engineer but then everyone specializes above that; you hire them as “analysts” and they figure out a business specialization that provides the career path rather than the technical career path. My skepticism about this “full stack business person” is that, well, most people just aren’t good at everything. We tried to get rid of just developer specialization with “full stack” roles, but at scale, this has yet to be widely successful. It turns out, specialization is valuable, and can be more valuable than being a middling generalist.</p><h4>Corollary: Will Efficiencies Kill Demand?</h4><p>So now we have to talk about what this will do to the overall demand for engineers. Will it plummet? Is the job category of “people who build software-based products” going to have the same massive decline as, say, manufacturing? It helps to know why manufacturing employment declined in the way it did. While there were many factors, we know that manufacturing got both much more efficient, and the demand for manufactured goods slowed.</p><p>Taking it as a given that AI will meaningfully improve the productivity of producing software-based products, do we think we will also saturate the demand for those products? Or will the demand continue to grow? Time will tell. The biggest AI proponents predict that efficiencies will reach some point that the AI satisfies them completely, so I guess demand doesn’t matter in that case. But I’m skeptical.</p><h4>Engineering is changing, but probably not going away</h4><p>I am not a futurist. I don’t believe yet that we are going to achieve “AGI” (whatever that means). I do believe you can, and people do, “write” a lot more code now via prompting, which is a step beyond the elaborate auto-complete copilots of even a year or so ago. How will this work over time, with many people, in increasingly complex systems? No one knows for sure, but my current bet is that specialization still matters, it still produces marginal utility, and thus the specialization of software engineering, while changing, will stick around.</p><p>No AI was used to write this post (unless you count spell check!)</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol><li>Write separate questions for each participant. Don’t just ask everyone the same question! It’s ok if you have one-two “lightning round”-type questions that are the same for each person, but each panelist answering the same question is boring, even when they give different answers.</li><li>Research the participants enough to tailor questions to them. Send them the questions in advance, so they can prepare; even if it’s just a few hours before the panel it’s better than springing them on them in the moment. Especially if you don’t know the panelists well! There is nothing more awkward than asking a question the person can’t answer (either because they don’t know, or worse, because they can’t talk about the topic due to non-disclosure or other limitations).</li><li>Think about the themes you want to address. It can just be 1–2, for a 4 person panel, you can probably do one question each participant/theme, for two total themes; with introductions, panelist back-and-forth, and audience questions, that usually will fill 45 minutes.</li><li>If you give them good questions, panelists will talk for a while. You don’t need a lot of questions to fill a lot of time. Do not overwhelm yourself or the panelists with long lists of possible questions.</li><li>It is tempting to talk a lot yourself. Sometimes it’s true that you are both a moderator and panelist, but make sure that’s the role you should be playing before you give an extended monologue on the topic when everyone in the audience is there to hear from the assembled panelists.</li><li>Pay active attention. Good moderators can make connections on the fly and call out interesting themes that the audience may or may not detect. You may also need to gently interrupt and move the discussion along if one panelist has gone on for a long time, or there is an extended back-and-forth between the panelists that is not productive to the conversation.</li></ol><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5ce10599623b" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 26, 2015, I posted a short blog post to the Rent the Runway engineering blog, <a href="https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder">Sharing Our Engineering Ladder</a>, with a quick intro to the RTR engineering career ladder and links to both <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxmQBrDZvj16veuc2OVO0wUX7a7vEKPM-57dNLXhuEk/edit?usp=sharing">long-text</a> versions. This was one of the first public engineering career ladders that came with a clear distinction between management and IC levels, and meaningful details about the requirements and expectations at each level.</p><p>I published these resources because, at that point, most of the companies that were writing ladders were either a) getting some consultant like Radford to help them bootstrap something, b) copying a big company that they had worked for in the past, or c) stealing a template from a friend’s company and modifying it. For teams without the resources to hire consultants, prior big company experience to draft on, or friends to copy, they were basically stuck. I knew that what we had created at RTR was special, because it had many different sources of inspiration, contribution from a smart team of tech leads and managers, and a lot of care behind it. And as an open source person, I believe in the value of sharing not only ideas but actual work for others to use, build upon, and expand, for the greater benefit of the tech community. Publishing the ladders for widespread use was an easy decision, and one that has had an impact on the industry: I still get occasional thank-yous from people who have used it as a baseline all these years later.</p><p>These days, this sort of thing is almost passé. Almost every company has done this work, many inspired by the very ladders we published, but <a href="https://github.com/bmoeskau/engineering-ladders?tab=readme-ov-file">others</a> inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Medium/snowflake">far</a> <a href="https://www.engineeringladders.com/EngineeringManager.html">different</a> <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/spotify-technology-career-steps/">approaches</a> published over the years. I am proud to have stoked a simmering conversation among leaders in the tech industry. It proved what I always knew: most people want a starting point to play off of when designing organizational processes as much as they want one for technical work. Even if all the starting point inspires is “ew, not this!”, it gives you something to riff off of.</p><h4>Advice For Writing</h4><p>I’ve done this exercise again at least twice over at different companies in the past decade, and it’s always a challenge. So here’s some brief advice for those embarking on this process.</p><ol><li>Don’t let (or make!) HR do all of the work. It’s really not their job to define expertise in your functions.</li><li>Details matter. Your ladder should be more prescriptive than a horoscope; it’s impossible to avoid all subjective language like “increasing complexity”, “large systems”, “high impact”, but pay attention to where you use that and try to provide ways of roughly measuring this where possible.</li><li>One great way to flesh out details is writing long-form text to accompany the spreadsheet-style ladder. I think it’s a shame people don’t do this more, even if they don’t publish it, because it helps you envision the work and catch things you might miss when writing bullet points.</li><li>You should not try to create a ladder that functions as a pure checklist or scorecard that guarantees promotion if people check enough boxes; promotions are as much about the needs of the organization as the skills of the employees.</li><li>Be honest: not every job family has ladders that start at the bottom and go to the top. Some should start in the middle and go up; some may start at the bottom and only go to somewhere in the middle. Don’t promise people that they can become the VP of X just because some people do job X, and don’t pretend that you should hire people straight out of school into jobs that are specializations that you only take on after years of working as a generalist.</li><li>Also, maybe you don’t need to create a job ladder for literally every job. There’s something to be said for the finance company catch-all analyst/associate/VP/MD scale to cover everyone, with ladders for large population jobs (such as engineering) where it makes sense.</li><li>Err on the side of more early-career levels rather than later-career ones. Assuming you are still hiring junior engineers (you really should be even in this AI era), the good ones will learn quickly and want to see career progress in their first few years of working. Once the path splits IC/management, just match the management levels and you’ll be fine.</li></ol><h4>Are Ladders Passé?</h4><p>Even as I write this, I’m not sure anyone will care. The industry is in backlash mode, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see many companies try again to make the “flat” organization work. But even with the aid of AI, I’m not convinced that we’ll overcome the human instinct to gather in groups and create leaders of those groups, and fight one another for power of those groups. <a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The Tyranny of Structurelessness</a> has yet to be overcome, and for those who still care about creating strong, transparent, equitable organizations, this work matters. Just please don’t make me personally write them again!</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many have predicted the death of the “junior engineer” thanks to AI; after all, if AI can do all of the simple tasks, we don’t need to hire people who are only capable of handling those tasks anymore. And indeed, I was at a dinner of director+-level engineering leaders recently where many said they had turned all of their hiring to solely focus on “senior engineers” in lieu of anyone else.</p><p>Anyone who has thought about this for a moment sees the obvious problems. How do people ever become “senior engineers” if they don’t start out as junior ones?</p><p>One possible answer can be found by observing a recent terminology shift in the way we talk about engineers. During the last 5 years I got away from differentiating between engineers by “senior” or “junior” and started referring to the latter as “early career.” Call it excessive wokeness, perhaps, but in a time when people were moving into tech from other professions, calling everyone who was just starting out in engineering “junior” felt awkward and wrong. Since <em>everyone </em>has to go through “early career” at some point, perhaps the answer is not that we aren’t hiring <em>early career</em> so much as we expect those folks to be more skilled, senior, independent from the jump? Better get busy with those side projects and internships, college students! Of course, why would we ever hire interns if we aren’t even hiring new grads?</p><p>But people mean more than skills when they talk about hiring only senior engineers; many times they also want independence of work habits, and the judgement that comes from having experienced different successes and failures. That is much harder to shortcut. I have seen many college students come through my teams over my career, and even ones with extremely strong programming skills and good work experience were rarely capable of reaching their potential without mentoring and management, and usually lacked the ability to reliably differentiate between ideas that sounded good but wouldn’t work in the context of the team/company/technology, and ideas that were a good fit given these constraints.</p><p>We could leave all of the training of early career people to big companies; they may be hiring fewer early career engineers but they’re still hiring them, and big companies have always been a good place for engineers to cut their teeth. But here I would argue we get to a different problem. As my friend <a href="https://x.com/theccoder/status/1844741140412502067">Shanti said on twitter</a>:</p><blockquote>Seniority isn’t a particular space, it’s just a label for what the particular organization values. Many Senior engineers are products of the incentive structures of their orgs, and part of that is, unfortunately, calcified Opinions.</blockquote><p>When you leave all training of early career engineers to big companies, you’re going to get a lot of big company Opinions coming out. One of the nice things about senior engineers trained at smaller companies and startups is that they are comfortable in ambiguity, they are comfortable in a mess, and they don’t necessarily bring quite as many Opinions, having been exposed to more varied technology in their formative years. I would guess that most startups want senior engineers who are not only technically solid and independent, but capable of adapting to the environment, and the best training for that comes from startups. You don’t absolutely have to work your early career in startups to have this flexibility (after all, I spent my early career in finance and managed to stay flexible enough), but it certainly helps.</p><p>At this stage of my career, I recognize that I define “senior” somewhat more strictly than many people. When I talk about senior hiring, I am not talking about people with 3–7 years of experience who can be trusted to write good code independently and own projects; I’m thinking about the people who can act as the technical leaders for that group. And if this is what you are hoping to hire, those magic 10Xers who can really take on the nasty projects and untangle them for you, I have bad news about relying on external senior hiring to do the job. Because the more senior you are hiring, the higher the likelihood that they will be quite brilliant but incapable of adapting to the culture of your company and engineering team enough to do the non-technical work that has to happen for these types of projects to succeed.</p><p>However, if you hire strong early career engineers, some percentage of them will turn out to have the potential to become those 10Xers. If you can retain them over time, they will grow to lead the game-changing initiatives of your company, being both technically capable and fully embedded in your company’s culture. Those years growing up with you give them an internal network and high baseline of trust that is so critical for success when you’re talking about big technology projects. Sure, not every early career hire will turn out this way: many will leave within the first three years, some that never found their footing, and others that were great but itchy to try new things. But I’ve yet to see a perfect shortcut; you’re going to hire the wrong people whether you hire only junior or only senior, and you’re inevitably going to lose some of the right ones either way.</p><p>If you’re thinking about the long game, and hoping to build a company that will last, you probably want to invest in at least some early career hiring during periods of growth. The truth is we’re in a prisoner’s dilemma here; you can try to be the company that defects and wins because of it, but if too many of us defect, we’re all going to pay. Given the uncertain nature of what you “win” by only hiring senior people in the first place, I would question the value of this bet. If you are working in a niche area, with a very small company that you expect to remain small, go nuts: hire and fire senior people until you get the right mix. But if you have aspirations to not just build a company, but to grow to a point where you can influence the industry, you may want to reconsider your all-senior stance. Don’t underestimate the value early career engineers can bring to a team; unless we’re a dying profession, their continued existance and success is the basis for our future.</p><p>PS: If you are hoping to hire only senior people so you can avoid having to manage them, you’re delusional. Enjoy your house of cards and pray there are no stiff breezes in your future.</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Notes on Sustainable Platform Engineering</h4><p>Readers of a certain age and heritage will remember CFEngine, one of the early popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine">configuration management</a> systems (still in use today!). It provides a powerful way for administrators to manage system configuration across heterogenous clusters of machines, and ushered in the age of automated configuration management, a key component of the modern technology ecosystem. I’ve worked with and managed teams responsible for cfengine infrastructure, and have seen first-hand the value and challenge of managing and operating these systems. But I have also seen the limitations of approaching platform engineering from this mindset.</p><p>Configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, and the orchestration thereof is a devilish problem for organizations. Significant innovation has been poured into this area, from advances in “Infrastructure as Code” offerings like terraform, to orchestration platforms like kubernetes. The problem of maintaining heterogenous environments, especially as these environments grow in dimensions of complexity (eg, all of the pieces that need to exist for you to deploy an application onto the cloud using a multitude of cloud services), is neverending. While we may have moved beyond cfengine, many modern platform engineering teams focus on this part of the stack, making it easy for application teams to select their appropriate archetype or blueprint to provision the cloud resources their application needs to run.</p><p>I happen to also think that this practice, particularly when it is the main focus of your platform team, is misguided. It comes from walking down a path that seems logical:</p><ol><li>Terraform sucks. Especially when you’re in a company that is moving to the cloud from an old datacenter model, and your initial approach is to make every app team write its own terraform to provision things, you quickly see that every team is spending a ton of time figuring this out. And a lot of the time they’re figuring out the same things! So why not save them some effort, centralize that terraform writing, and create some patterns for everyone to adopt. That makes sense, right? This gets “day 0” (initial deployment) quickly.</li><li>Then you start to think, well, there’s a lot of other things we could configure too! We could configure observability so they’re set up for appropriate logging and alerts. We could allow them to specify the level of availability they need and provision them into multiple zones or regions. All of this is great, and useful; it gives application teams better deployments. So why not keep going down this path?</li><li>(sometimes) Even though terraform sucks, and we think we should centralize it, we don’t want to hide it from the app teams completely either, because that is restrictive. So we don’t completely hide it away from them: the code our blueprints generate is checked in nicely to a repo that application teams can access and tweak as needed. We want to be <em>helpful</em> but not <em>limiting.</em></li></ol><p>You can spend a good long time building this way; indeed, keeping up with the changes in cloud offerings and application team needs means you can probably do it forever. So, why not take this approach? It isn’t a stupid thing to do, many teams have used it to reasonable success. But it also relies on a few assumptions, sometimes spoken, sometimes not.</p><ul><li>Assumption #1: While there are enough similarities in the infrastructure needed to provision that we can create these “blueprints” and have them be useful for many applications, there aren’t any better abstractions that we could create for these similar groups of applications. We really don’t want to have much if any production software that we (the platform team) are operating that application teams rely on beyond deployment stages, because that puts us on a critical path that we’re not sure we can handle.</li><li>Assumption #2: The cloud provider operates all of the underlying systems in such a way that they rarely perturb the application teams, and the app teams can rely on themselves or their SREs to manage it all when they do. We can be there to help debug but we don’t need to be part of critical production support.</li><li>Assumption #3: The biggest bottleneck that we can solve for application teams is getting the stack that their application needs provisioned and running in the cloud. This seems totally obvious at the beginning of a cloud journey where the whole company is trying to figure out how to do this stuff in the first place, and very few people are operating meaningful applications in the cloud.</li></ul><p>Now that I have extrapolated these assumptions, you may see where I am going. If you agree with all of these, I wish you the best; you may very well be correct for your organization that this is the right approach! But there are some major limitations that fall out of these assumptions.</p><h4>Limitation #1: We don’t want to be on the hook for operations, so we don’t want to build software we have to operate, especially on the production critical path.</h4><p>Avoiding operations is, generally speaking, a bad idea for platform teams. The value of a platform team is often commensurate with how much operational burden they are able to remove from application teams, and you undermine your value by shying away from it. When there is a budget crunch, teams that are doing “enablement” are cut long before those that are responsible for running critical systems; one is viewed as optional, but the other is known to be essential.</p><p>Understandably, sometimes application teams don’t want you in the middle of their operations, especially if you aren’t very good at them in the first place. But it’s very hard for you to be half-in and half-out of ownership when you’re the experts in all of the configuration and infrastructure provisioning; it’s hard to know how to do that without knowing the underlying infrastructure well from an operational perspective, which means you’re likely to be needed during incidents to help debug what is happening; or, the app team knows enough that they don’t need you and then…. what are they really getting from using your blueprints at that point? Maybe it helped them bootstrap initially, but now it’s probably just a pain for their experts to translate your definitions to their own mental models and feel comfortably in control of what is happening.</p><p>Application teams that want to own everything themselves, should; the ones that need it will do it well, the ones that don’t do it well will have a clearer idea of the cost/benefit tradeoff of owning everything themselves.</p><p>For everyone else, I would argue that if you can find enough similar blueprints, you should consider whether you can build a platform that they deploy their application on top of, rather than just maintaining configuration for them. To be clear, this is <em>tricky. </em>It’s tempting to jump to “trying to build Heroku for the company” and many of us have seen that fail. At the same time, if there is meaningful work to be done to combine a bunch of parts together so that a common group of applications can be deployed into the cloud, I think it’s likely that there is something you could be operating. It might be a thin shim of software that takes hosted kubernetes with some company-specific controllers and integration with company-specific entitlements and finops support, and allows your application teams to specify a much simpler subset of configuration parameters and deploy their applications into that platform. Ask yourself, what could you build and operate yourself that would meaningfully free application teams from having to understand and maintain so much of the underlying infrastructure stack?</p><p>It’s important to note that this may not apply to a small company that can use a few select cloud provider platforms directly to do what they need (the aforementioned Heroku, Vercel, AppEngine, etc). I would in fact not advise trying to spend a lot of developer time building your own platforms if out-of-the-box vendor offerings will do! But for larger companies or certain types of complexity, writing some (not too much) custom software to make something that does what your company needs and hides the bare cloud complexity from the application teams can be worthwhile.</p><h4>Limitation #2: We don’t actually want to write our own software.</h4><p>Our bespoke kubernetes platform is an example of a real type of platform that I’ve seen built and operated by a platform engineering team. It works because kubernetes allows you to write your own code to modify its behavior; and while this is the kind of tricky work you may not want to do too often, it is very useful for taking a powerful general-purpose system and focusing it on specific usecases that you can then offer as a service.</p><p>You may be thinking, surely if this is useful someone else will build it, or the cloud provider will offer it, but there’s no reason that I should really need to write software myself. But there is a wide gulf between building a platform that is so generally useful that it can be sold to many types of companies with diverse usecases (very very hard), and building something useful within a very specific environment. In particular, the integration of the generally useful components with the quirks of your company (often relating to identity/entitlements, corporate hierarchy/department codes for billing, and other such company-specific details) is a fruitful place to look to balance writing just enough code to create a valuable platform.</p><h4>Limitation #3: We don’t want to become a bottleneck.</h4><p>The appeal of the blueprint idea is that it has the escape hatch; anything that could be done in terraform is at least theoretically fair game, the application teams can work to enable more cloud things themselves, and you haven’t created any real restrictions, just nice paved paths that make certain patterns easier. And I am very sympathetic to giving teams a way out of your choices so that you don’t limit the company’s innovation through the capabilities of your platforms.</p><p>Unfortunately, leaving the wide world of possibilities open retains all of the downsides of the wide world of possibilities. Choice is always appealing in the beginning and often limiting over time as every bespoke choice must be supported indefinitely. If you allow every team to independently choose what they want all the time, you get what we call the <em>over-general swamp. </em>Each different choice requires its own glue (one-off code for integration, automation, configuration, etc), and while glue is quick to create, it is painful to change.</p><p>Taking a product approach to platforms doesn’t mean making everyone happy all the time and building exactly what they ask you to build. It means taking the time to understand what is actually making your application teams less efficient, and doing hard work yourself so they don’t have to. Sometimes that hard work is making curatorial choices about what is supported and what is not, and making some niche group unhappy. As any product manager will tell you, it’s stressful bearing the burden of setting strategy and making bets that don’t always pay off.</p><h4>Products, not Scripts</h4><p>To wrap this up, Platform Engineering done well is more than configuration management and infrastructure provisioning. It is doing the hard work to identify, build, and operate abstractions that allow application teams spend less time on the underlying technology and more on solving problems for their business. Instead of thinking about how you can support the scripting and automation of infinite variations, think about the products you can build to cover the most common archetypes in a way that goes beyond the act of provisioning and deployment.</p><p><em>This is the first in a series of articles where I attempt to work through some thoughts on how to differentiate platform engineering teams and create meaningful value through platform engineering. In that sense, these notes are seeking audience resonance, and I am curious to hear your questions and reactions! Thanks to James Turnbull and Pete Miron for their early comments.</em></p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard that I have a new book coming out. With co-author Ian Nowland, I’ve written a book called <a href="https://amzn.to/3MwcgGo">Platform Engineering: A Guide for Technical, Product, and People Leaders.</a> And as I discussed recently on the <a href="https://refactoring.fm/p/founder-mode-and-the-managers-path">Refactoring podcast</a>, it serves as much as a follow-on to <a href="http://amzn.to/2nw1QN5">The Manager’s Path</a> as it does a book for the niche audience of platform engineering leaders.</p><p>I wrote the first draft of The Manager’s Path in late 2015, after a four year period of intense learning and growth that came from being a new-ish manager leading engineering at a growing startup. In retrospect, it is amazing how much of what I wrote then still holds up to my own high standards after many additional years of management at larger companies and at larger scale. There’s very little I would change about the book; I channeled lessons that were fresh in my mind directly to the page, and with the help of many reviewers and contributors, I believe I captured much of the essence of management growth.</p><p>You might expect my follow-up to be about either managing at much larger scale (say, senior management at a big company), or more focus on the executive management side of things. But the truth is that management at big companies is as much about the quirks of the big company as it is about management itself, and executive management is well-trod ground that I’m not sure I have a novel insight into. So instead of pursing these obvious follow-ons, I wanted to write about what I’ve been learning since I wrote my last book, Platform Engineering.</p><p>Platform Engineering, whatever you might have heard, is not about a particular technology (say, kubernetes, or integrated developer portals), nor is it just a renaming of DevOps, nor is it a silver bullet that you build to solve all of your developer productivity problems. It is, in my opinion, the evolution of software infrastructure in response to the growing complexity of modern software engineering. And while there is a lot of technology needed to make it work, one of the reasons that companies struggle with their platform teams is that the industry lacks an understanding of how these teams should be structured and managed in order to succeed.</p><p>This is where the book comes in. If you are an experienced manager of application engineering teams, you may be great at getting large teams of people to adopt agile practices, ship quickly, and manage technical debt to a reasonable level. But the nuances of platform mean you need a somewhat different set of skills to survive. You need to balance agility and speed of shipping for the ability to plan and execute long-running initiatives. You may have significantly more control over your team’s roadmap, which means you are both engineer and product lead all at once, and your stakeholder group in this case becomes much more diverse and challenging. The operational expectations of shared software services are very high, and you need a team that mixes software, systems, and reliability engineering effectively. You’ve gotta deal with the inevitable push for the next great thing that your team wants to build to replace the old systems, and manage constant change in both your own systems and underlying dependencies without constantly pushing more work out to the application teams that use your stack. And, especially these days, you have to effectively defend the existence of your organization when there are budget crunches.</p><p>This is hard work. If I have one concern for the future of platform engineering, it’s that it might be so hard to pull off that companies will abandon it because there aren’t enough leaders who can do the job. But I also believe these skills are the next evolution of good engineering management, and even application engineering leaders would do well to familiarize themselves with some of them. We all need to occasionally run long, engineering-driven projects; we’d be better off if everyone got a little bit savvier at how to approach them. The lessons of rewrites and migrations are useful if you have inherited a legacy application stack that may need to evolve to meet your business demands. Developing product sense and making sure your own teams are applying it can help you become a better leader, and while you may have fewer stakeholder relationships to wrangle, that is still a skill every engineering manager needs to develop.</p><p>I have spent my career in the relentless pursuit of figuring out how to do hard things well, and I love sharing what I’ve learned with the world. If you care about improving the working lives of engineers through technology, this book will tell you why that’s hard to do, and give you some approaches to handle those challenges.</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a new pg article making the rounds called “<a href="https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">Founder Mode</a>”. The biggest surprise to me is how, despite saying almost nothing, it has attracted wide attention; possibly because people love to be given new ways to separate and stereotype one another, especially if this reinforces their belief about themselves as good and virtuous.</p><p>The article goes to pains to create a straw man of nefarious manager culture: these managers are “taught” (by whom? Is the idea this happens in business school? Do we need to explain to SV people that there has been a huge amount of writing and research on building and running good companies that goes far beyond Taylorism?) to turn the company into black boxes that you manage via outcomes. But when you do this, all that happens is that the black boxes are run by “professional fakers” who drive the company into the ground. To avoid this trap, you must run your company through some nebulous method called “founder mode.” (What is it? No one can say! But it’s definitely not “hire smart people and get out of their way”, even though that’s basically what Jobs claims to have done).</p><p>My assertion is that “founder mode”, naively applied, creates the very conditions that lead to those nefarious professional managers. I’ve seen it happen at companies big and small with founder-type leaders. The process goes something like this:</p><p>The founder leader is a passionate details person. They care deeply about the company, of course, and the product, and want to be involved in everything. This works out ok but there are areas that, despite their talent and intelligence, they can’t quite master an understanding of. Unfortunately, their belief that they need to be in the details and have opinions about everything leads them to a huge weakness. When you don’t really understand something well, but you want to sound smart about it, what do you do? You go to someone you trust that does know it, and launder their opinions as your own. And so long as this person really does know their stuff well, this isn’t a bad idea.</p><p>But, over time, smart senior executives realize that you have these blind spots. Instead of giving you the full picture about their areas, they tailor the information to what they know will resonate with you. You may try to check in with other people on this, but the bigger the company gets, the less time you have to double check their work; and anyway, the best sharks in executive leadership know to stack the bench with their flunkies who can be trusted to tell the founder only what that executive wants you to hear.</p><p>This information bubble, combined with the belief that their own judgment will win out in the long run, sets this type of founder leader up for manipulation. The manipulation comes when you refuse to “hire smart people and get out of their way,” and instead you “hire smart people and micromanage them until they learn how to manipulate you so that they can do whatever they think is right and you will be blind to the consequences.” Because smart people are going to do what they think is right, and you are never going to perfectly outmaneuver them.</p><p>The only solution to this is to think early and often about the systems of accountability you have to set up. This is much, much harder than micromanaging details, because every system of accountability you set up will eventually be gamed. So in addition to accountability, you need to foster a strong, ethical company culture that encourages transparency while allowing for some mistakes.</p><p>Bryan Cantrill says it well in <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/reflections-on-founder-mode">this post</a>:</p><blockquote>Founders seeking to internalize Graham’s advice should recast it by asking themselves how they can foster mutual trust — and how they can build the systems that allow trust to be strengthened even as the team expands.</blockquote><p>Indeed, if “founder mode” is a real thing at all, it is merely the recognition that there is no one-size-fits-all system to running a successful company, and if you want to do it well, you have to keep evolving the approach to meet the current needs.</p><p><em>Enjoy this post?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan” — Eliel Saarinen</blockquote><p>Frequently we will be given problems to solve by other people. Early in our career, these problems will usually be well-scoped and specific, eg:</p><ul><li>Add this new data to an interface</li><li>Make an endpoint that returns a certain specific calculation or piece of data.</li></ul><p>And as we grow as engineers these tasks become bigger but often the success criteria remains well-defined:</p><ul><li>Write a service to manage the state of a customer.</li><li>Create a new interface that allows developers to manage and track the status of their code change from review to deployment.</li></ul><p>There are often plenty of decisions to be made in implementing these designs, but we are not identifying the problem to solve ourselves, just building the system to solve it well.</p><p>A major challenge that I see many people hit right around the time they become senior engineers is that they want to progress farther in their career, but they expect that the way they can do that is that they will be given a hard problem to solve that can only be solved by the level of technical skill they’ve gained so far. In fact, they expect that the career path from senior engineer to even loftier heights (depending on your company that might be things like “staff engineer” or “principal engineer”) will go much as it has gone up through to senior: you’re given increasingly harder problems, and you get to use your skills to solve them.</p><p>I didn’t write <a href="https://amzn.to/3MuiUMA">The Staff Engineer’s Path</a> because I’m not qualified to talk about a path I didn’t follow. But what I can tell you based on my years of managing people throughout the stages of their career and watching friends who are on the individual contributor path is this: it is exceedingly rare that the path past senior engineer comes from being handed increasingly hard problems. It’s not that there aren’t hard problems to be solved, for sure, but they are generally being solved by the people who were already around on the team when the problem was discovered. And most of us don’t work in research, so the job of exploring the edges of possibility and discovering completely new things is not part of what we’re expected to do. Instead, at the senior levels, we are expected to identify problems that match business opportunities with something that technology can solve.</p><p>The blending of these two things, business opportunities and technology, is where you need to turn your eye, senior engineer. But that doesn’t mean you need to become a product manager, or a manager-manager, or even an expert in the business. Instead you should look at the problems you’ve been solving and that your team is solving, and follow Saarinen’s advice: look at them in the next larger context*. Here are some examples.</p><p><strong>Current Context: A Bespoke Storage System</strong></p><p>Let’s say that you are on a team that supports a bespoke storage system that has been built up over years for your company. You’ve been something of an expert in the internals of that system, how it works, how it scales, you have added some features to it, and you are capable of teaching other developers how to use it.</p><p>The next-biggest context to start to understand here is how this storage system supports the company that is using it. Why do you need a bespoke storage system? What are people putting into it? What are their complaints about the system? What are they using it for that surprises you? You need to understand not only the way the system works itself, but the way the people who are using the system interact with it. This gives you the larger context that it is operating in, and will help you see the next opportunities for this area. Is it time to bring in a new type of storage system, one that fits with some of the data your users are producing that isn’t being served well by the current system? You are supporting a bespoke storage system, in an era where companies are trying to move away from bespoke systems in favor of open source or cloud hosted solutions. What does this mean for the future of your system? How can you get ahead of that trend, either by showing true differentiation between what your company needs vs the external options, or by embracing that trend and drawing down the differences to allow the company to eventually move to one or more of the external options?</p><p>The lesson from larger context here is that sometimes the advanced move is not to build a more complex thing, but to enable the company to embrace the broader trends in storage systems. But when the right thing is to build a bespoke solution, you will only do that well if you understand why you need to differentiate and how to make the case for that based on the understanding of the larger context around your system, namely, its users.</p><p><strong>Current Context: An Inventory Management System</strong></p><p>Now let’s take a very business-focused example. Imagine that you are an engineer on an inventory management system. You have overseen the development of this system to account for the nuances of the company that uses it. You understand very well how the operations team thinks about inventory, how they plan to buy new things when inventory runs low, and the kinds of reports they want to see on a regular basis about all things inventory.</p><p>The next-biggest context here could be a few things. It could be the entire context of warehouse management. If your company not only tracks inventory but actually manages the warehouse they use to store inventory, they probably have some warehouse management systems that you have integrated with your inventory management system. How well do you understand that world? How does your inventory management system fit into it? Are there opportunities to build out better integrations that could provide more accurate reports for the operations team forecasting inventory needs?</p><p>The other side of this information flow of course is the information that you’re getting from the customers themselves. You’re tracking customer behavior in some way, if you’re working in any sort of modern commerce company. Are you automatically feeding information about customer interest in your products into the inventory management system to improve planning? Or, can you use information about inventory management to show to customers which items are about to be sold out?</p><p>These questions may sound like product questions, but in many cases they are all about technical challenges. Integrating all of these disparate systems together in an effective way is challenging. Even if all of these systems were developed in-house, they will have evolved at different rates and in different ways, and feeding new data from one system into another can sometimes require that you rethink the entire way the systems work together. If you built your inventory management system to do batch processing, for example, because you never expected that inventory would change fast enough to need real-time updates, you don’t have an easy way to feed information about low stock dynamically to the website. In fact, may websites fake statistics like the number of users buying a particular item because they have no easy way of feeding this information back and forth.</p><p>You need to think about the larger context of your system both to identify business opportunities that it could be filling, but also to predict how the technology you’ve built to support the current needs might fail you if you needed to integrate with a new model.</p><p><strong>Current Context: A Developer Tools Team</strong></p><p>Our last example puts you in the context of a team that supports the tools and processes other engineers in your company use to develop software. You are the person who supports Jenkins, and all of its various integrations, for doing build and test. You know Jenkins inside and out, and have created an impressive set of automation that makes it easy for you to manage a large number of build and test pipelines for the company. However, this project has only been around for a little while and many teams still don’t have good continuous integration processes.</p><p>The next-larger context here is one of education. How are people using your product? How many teams understand the power of the automation that a system like Jenkins can provide? Where are there additional places that can take advantage of this system? What would be the blockers for them taking advantage of the system?</p><p>By teaching people how to use the system and getting more users into your system, you will start to understand the patterns of testing and integration more broadly at your company. You may identify pieces of support that are missing that would get more teams to be able to release more frequently, such as a good feature flagging system. You may identify that the artifacts you build are huge and take a long time to create, and this could lead you down a path of figuring out how to make those artifacts smaller or faster to build. You may simply identify the need to set up some kind of classes for new developers about how to write good unit and integration tests, so that they can get value from running their code through your pipelines.</p><p>What all of these examples show is that, as engineers, when we are looking to do a larger project than the ones we’ve done before, we need to step out of the context that we normally operate in. When you look one context bigger, you will see immediate new opportunities that you can tackle in adjacent areas. So don’t wait for the next project to come to you, seek it out by looking at the slightly bigger picture. That is where you will find your growth.</p><p><em>*You look only one context bigger because it is easy to overdo things and violate our “evolve complex systems from simple systems” principle when you try to go too broad.</em></p><p><em>Enjoy this post?
