&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjalivenkatraman/"&gt;Gitanjali Venkatraman&lt;/a&gt; does wonderful illustrations of complex subjects (which is why I was so happy to work with her on our &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html"&gt;Expert Generalists&lt;/a&gt; article). She has now published the latest in her series of illustrated guides: tackling the complex topic of &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf"&gt;Mainframe Modernization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/blog/mainframe_modernisation_illustrated_guide_2025.pdf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2025/gitanjali-mainframe.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it she illustrates the history and value of mainframes, why modernization is so tricky, and how to tackle the problem by breaking it down into tractable pieces. I love the clarity of her explanations, and smile frequently at her way of enhancing her words with her quirky pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gergely Orosz on &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m7xd33hi5c2d"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unpopular opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Current code review tools just don’t make much sense for AI-generated code&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When reviewing code I really want to know:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The prompt made by the dev&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What corrections the other dev made to the code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Clear marking of code AI-generated not changed by a human&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people pushed back saying they don’t (and shouldn’t care) whether it was written by a human, generated by an LLM, or copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view it matters &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; - because of the second vital purpose of code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked why do code reviews, most people will answer the first vital purpose - quality control. We want to ensure bad code gets blocked before it hits &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#mainline"&gt;mainline&lt;/a&gt;. We do this to avoid bugs and to avoid other quality issues, in particular comprehensibility and ease of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hear the second vital purpose less often: code review is a mechanism to communicate and educate. If I’m submitting some sub-standard code, and it gets rejected, I want to know why so that I can improve my programming. Maybe I’m unaware of some library features, or maybe there’s some project-specific standards I haven’t run into yet, or maybe my naming isn’t as clear as I thought it was. Whatever the reasons, I need to know in order to learn. And my employer needs me to learn, so I can be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to know the writer of the code we review both so we can communicate our better practice to them, but also to know how to improve things. With a human, its a conversation, and perhaps some documentation if we realize we’ve needed to explain things repeatedly. But with an LLM it’s about how to modify its context, as well as humans learning how to better drive the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering why I’ve been making a lot of posts like this recently? &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html"&gt;I explain why&lt;/a&gt; I’ve been reviving the link blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/"&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt; describes how he uses LLMs to build disposable but useful web apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His repository includes all these tools, together with transcripts of the chats that got the LLMs to build them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660"&gt;Obie Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;: while many engineers are underwhelmed by AI tools, some senior engineers are finding them really valuable. He feels that senior engineers have an oft-unspoken mindset, which in conjunction with an LLM, enables the LLM to be much more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Levels of abstraction and generalization problems get talked about a lot because they’re easy to name. But they’re far from the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Other tools show up just as often in real work:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A sense for blast radius. Knowing which changes are safe to make loudly and which should be quiet and contained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A feel for sequencing. Knowing when a technically correct change is still wrong because the system or the team isn’t ready for it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An instinct for reversibility. Preferring moves that keep options open, even if they look less elegant in the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An awareness of social cost. Recognizing when a clever solution will confuse more people than it helps.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An allergy to false confidence. Spotting places where tests are green but the model is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/"&gt;Emil Stenström&lt;/a&gt; built an HTML5 parser in python using coding agents, using Github Copilot in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 3.7. He automatically approved most commands. It took him “a couple of months on off-hours”, including at least one restart from scratch. The parser now passes all the tests in html5lib test suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After writing the parser, I still don’t know HTML5 properly. The agent wrote it for me. I guided it when it came to API design and corrected bad decisions at the high level, but it did ALL of the gruntwork and wrote all of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I handled all git commits myself, reviewing code as it went in. I didn’t understand all the algorithmic choices, but I understood when it didn’t do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he gives an overview of what happens, there’s not very much information on his workflow and how he interacted with the LLM. There’s certainly not enough detail here to try to replicate his approach. This is contrast to Simon Willison (above) who has detailed links to his chat transcripts - although they are much smaller tools and I haven’t looked at them properly to see how useful they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear, however, is the vital need for a comprehensive test suite. Much of his work is driven by having that suite as a clear guide for him and the LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn’t have written it this quickly without the agent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But “quickly” doesn’t mean “without thinking.” I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                                  ❄                                  ❄    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Simon Willison &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/"&gt;ported the library to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his lessons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/"&gt;designing the agentic loop&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experience at Thoughtworks backs this up. We’ve been doing a fair bit of work recently in legacy modernization (mainframe and otherwise) using AI to migrate substantial software systems. Having a robust test suite is necessary (but not sufficient) to making this work. I hope to share my colleagues’ experiences on this in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I leave Willison’s post, I should highlight his final open questions on the legalities, ethics, and effectiveness of all this - they are well-worth contemplating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2025-12-16T10:06:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://martinfowler.com/articles/writing-fragments.html</id>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re a regular reader of my site, you’ll have noticed that in the
last few months I’ve been making a &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/20251204-frags.html"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of “fragments” &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-11-19-frags.html"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. Such a post
is a short post with a bunch of little, unconnected segments. These are
usually a reference to something I’ve found on the web, sometimes a small
thought of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wouldn’t have covered these topics with posts on my
own site. Instead I would use Twitter, either retweeting someone else’s
point, or just highlighting something I’d found. But since the Muskover,
Twitter has effectively died. I’m not saying that due to any technical
issues with the site, which has mostly just been fine, nor directly due to
any of the policy changes there. The point is that lots of people have left, so that
the audience I would have reached with Twitter is now fragmented. Some
remain on X, but I see more activity on LinkedIn. There’s also Fediverse/Mastodon
and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for short posts is that I can no longer just post in one
place. When I announce new articles on martinfowler.com, I announce now on
four social media sites (X, LinkedIn, Fediverse, and Bluesky). It makes
sense to do this, but I don’t want to go through all this hassle for the
kind of micro-post that Twitter served so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve started to batch them up. When I see something interesting, I
make a note. When I have enough notes, I post a fragments post. Initially I
did this in a rather ad-hoc way, just using the same mechanisms I use for
most articles, but last week I started to put in some more deliberate
mechanisms into the site. (If you’re observant, you’ll spot that in the URLs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit of all of this, at least in my book, is that it means my material is
now fully visible in RSS. I’m probably showing my age, but I’m a big fan of RSS
(or in my case, strictly Atom) feeds. I miss the feel of the heyday of the
“blogosphere” before it got steamrolled by social media, and these fragment
posts are, of course, just the same as the link blogs from that era. I still use my
RSS reader every day to keep up with writers I like. (I’m pleased that Substack
makes its content available via RSS.) It bothered me a bit that my micro-founts
of Twitter knowledge weren’t visible on RSS, but was too lazy to do something
about it. Now I don’t need to - the fragments are available in my RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/03/magazine/chatbot-writing-style.html?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Why does AI write like… that&lt;/a&gt; (NYT, gift link). Sam Kriss delves into the quiet hum of AI writing. AI’s work is not compelling prose: it’s phantom text, ghostly scribblings, a spectre woven into our communal tapestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2025/12/test-desiderata-2-0/"&gt;Emily Bache&lt;/a&gt; has written a set of Test Desiderata, building on some earlier writing from Kent Beck. She lists the characteristics of good tests, and how they support her four “macro desiderata” - the properties of a sound test suite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Predict success in production&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fast to get feedback&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support ongoing code design change&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Low total cost of ownership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has a great list of other writers’ lists of good test characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/the-eus-fine-against-x-is-not-about-speech-or-censorship/"&gt;Daphne Keller&lt;/a&gt; explains that the EUs fines on X aren’t about free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023. One is about verification — X’s blue checkmarks on user accounts — and two are about transparency. These charges have nothing to do with what content is on X, or what user speech the platform should or should not allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; The Reverse-Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. … And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Like an Amazon delivery driver… the van can’t drive itself and can’t get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

Like any such study, we shouldn’t take its results as definitive, but there seems enough there to make it a handy data point. The key point is that the AI code probably reduced the quality of the code base - at least if static code analysis can be trusted to determine quality. And perhaps some worrying second-order effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This study shows more than 800 popular GitHub projects with code quality degrading after adopting AI tools. It’s hard not to see a form of context collapse playing out in real time. If the public code that future models learn from is becoming more complex and less maintainable, there’s a real risk that newer models will reinforce and amplify those trends, producing even worse code over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob’s post is typical of much of the thoughtful writing on AI. We can see its short-term benefits, but worry about its long-term impact. But on a much deeper note is this lovely story from &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/"&gt;Jim Highsmith&lt;/a&gt;. Jim has turned 0x50, and has spent the last decade fighting Parkinson’s disease. To help him battle it he has two AI assisted allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Between my neural implants and Byron’s digital guidance, I now collaborate with two adaptive systems: one for motion, one for thought. Neither replaces me. Both extend me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you read anything on AI this week, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-80th-birthday-i-bought-myself-new-brain-jim-highsmith-8qcrc/"&gt;make it be this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It offers a positive harbinger for our future and opens my mind to a whole different perspective of the role of AI in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently announced that it disrupted a Chinese state-sponsored operation abusing Claude Code. Jim Gumbley looks at the core lesson to learn from this, that we have to understand the serious risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/security/anthropic-ai-espionage-disclosure-signal-from-noise?utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dt_bs_rp-in-clt_tech_thought_leaders_2025-11&amp;amp;gh_src=d1fe17bc1us"&gt;AI Jailbreaking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New AI tools are able to analyze your attack surface at the next level of granularity. As a business leader, that means you now have two options: wait for someone else to run AI-assisted vulnerability detection against your attack surface, or run it yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of claims that AI Vibe Coding can replace software developers, something that folks like me (perhaps with a bias) think unlikely. &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gergely.pragmaticengineer.com/post/3m75kmb7bh22i"&gt;Gergely Orosz&lt;/a&gt; shared this tidbit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Talked with an exec at a tech company who is obsessed with AI and has been for 3 years. Not a developer but company makes software. Uses AI for everything, vibe codes ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Has a team of several devs to implement his vibe coded prototypes to sg workable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear more about this (and similar stories)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://checkeagle.com/checklists/njr/a-month-of-chat-oriented-programming/"&gt;Nick Radcliffe&lt;/a&gt; writes about a month of using AI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I spent a solid month “pair programming” with Claude Code, trying to suspend disbelief and adopt a this-will-be-productive mindset. More specifically, I got Claude to write well over 99% of the code produced during the month. I found the experience infuriating, unpleasant, and stressful before even worrying about its energy impact. Ideally, I would prefer not to do it again for at least a year or two. The only problem with that is that it “worked”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stresses that his approach is the “polar opposite” of Vibe Coding. The post is long, and rambles a bit, but is worthwhile because he talks in detail about his workflow and how he uses the tool. Such posts are important so we can learn the nitty-gritty of how our programming habits are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines is a post of &lt;a href="https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-55-issue"&gt;Brian Chambers&lt;/a&gt; on his workflow, that he calls Issue-Driven Development (and yes, I’m also sick of the “something-driven” phraseology). As with much of the better stuff I’ve heard about AI assisted work, it’s all about carefully managing the context window, ensuring the AI is focused on the right things and not distracted by textual squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on the road in Europe for the last couple of weeks, and while I was there Thoughtworks released &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"&gt;volume 33 of our Technology Radar&lt;/a&gt;. Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/podcast.png" alt="Gergely and I recording the podcast" width="400px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of &lt;a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/"&gt;The Pragmatic Engineer&lt;/a&gt;, and he arranged to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmI4XKTa0U"&gt;record a podcast&lt;/a&gt; with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/images/frags-2025-11/features.webp" alt="Kent's graph of options vs features" width="400px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html"&gt;high quality software is cheaper&lt;/a&gt;. This time, &lt;a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/why-does-development-slow"&gt;Kent Beck&lt;/a&gt; creates a unique perspective to this chart, dispensing with the temporal axis to help think in terms of optionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in another life, Edward has finally finished the great migration of the Heavy Cardboard studio and returns to the tubes with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/e8juRvm9h0c"&gt;our first game in the new digs&lt;/a&gt;. (No surprise that it’s Age of Steam.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m very concerned about the security dangers of LLM-enabled browsers, as it’s just too easy for them to contain the &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/"&gt;Lethal Trifecta&lt;/a&gt;. For up-to-date eyes on these issues, I follow the writings of coiner of that phrase: Simon Willison. Here &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/"&gt;he examines&lt;/a&gt; a post on how OpenAI is thinking about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My takeaways from all of this? It’s not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/10/26/youre-probably-listening-to-the-wrong-people-about-ai-coding/"&gt;Rob Bowley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of strong opinions on AI assisted coding. Some engineers swear by it. Others say it’s dangerous. And of course, as is the way with the internet, nuanced positions get flattened into simplistic camps where everyone’s either on one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A lot of the problem is that people aren’t arguing about the same thing. They’re reporting different experiences from different vantage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His view is that beginners are very keen on AI-coding but they don’t see the problems they are creating. Experienced folks do see this, but it takes a further level of experience to realize that &lt;em&gt;when used well&lt;/em&gt; these tools are still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I’ve regularly seen sceptical experienced engineers change their view once they’ve been shown how you can blend modern/XP practices with AI assisted coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot is this, is that you have be aware of the experience level of whoever is writing about this stuff - and that experience is not just in software development generally, but also in how to make use of LLMs. One thing that rings clearly from reading Simon Willison and Birgitta Böckeler is that effective use of LLMs is a skill that takes a while to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Brown and Garfield, like most comic strip characters, never changed over the decades. But &lt;a href="https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/10/26/youre-probably-listening-to-the-wrong-people-about-ai-coding/"&gt;Doonesbury’s&lt;/a&gt; cast aged, had children, and some have died (I miss Lacey). Gary Trudeau retired from writing daily strips a few years ago, but his &lt;a href="https://x.com/RealRBHJr"&gt;reruns of older strips&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best things in the shabby remains of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, he reran one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/doonesbury/strip/archive/2025/10/22"&gt;memorable strips&lt;/a&gt; in its whole run. The very first frame of Doonesbury introduced the character “B.D.”, a football jock never seen without his football helmet, or when on duty, his military helmet. This panel was the first time in over thirty years that B.D. was shown without a helmet, readers were so startled that they didn’t immediately notice that the earlier explosion had removed his leg. This set off a remarkable story arc about the travails of a wounded veteran. It’s my view that future generations will find Doonesbury to be a first-class work of literature, and a thoughtful perspective on contemporary America.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathias Verraes&lt;/strong&gt; writes about the relationship between &lt;a href="https://verraes.net/2025/08/domain-and-bounded-contexts-dont-map-one-on-one/"&gt;Domains and Bounded Contexts&lt;/a&gt; in Domain-Driven Design. It’s a common myth that there should always be a 1:1 relationship between them, but although it’s sometimes the case, deeper modeling often exposes a more interesting structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gary Marcus:&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/opinion/ai-specialized-potential.html?unlocked_article_code=1.vE8.Rl9N.C2_mHrQ_1hHz&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;NYT Gift Link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the strengths of A.I. are truly to be harnessed, the tech industry should stop focusing so heavily on these one-size-fits-all tools and instead concentrate on narrow, specialized A.I. tools engineered for particular problems. Because, frankly, they’re often more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the truly annoying things about the US tax system is that we can’t easily file our tax returns electronically. In recent years an initiative called “Direct File” sought to fix that. &lt;strong&gt;Matt Bracken&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://fedscoop.com/direct-file-future-of-tax-filing-fellows/"&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of how they developed a highly-regarded system in 25 states, but was canned by the Trump administration. He also explains how the creators of Direct File are working to prepare the ground for it to reappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security issues are only getting worse, but the US government agency for cybersecurity is having its staff reassigned to other duties. Detailed story in &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-08/homeland-security-cyber-personnel-reassigned-to-jobs-in-trump-s-deportation-push"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (paywalled) and an open (but more polemic) summary on &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/17/trumps-cisa-raid-pulling-cybersecurity-experts-off-critical-infrastructure-defense-to-process-deportation-paperwork/"&gt;Techdirt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Changes have hit particularly hard in CISA’s Capacity Building team, which writes emergency directives and oversees cybersecurity for the government’s highest value assets, the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense and law enforcement are valuable things for a government to do, but here they seem to be walking away from a growing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <uri>https://martinfowler.com</uri>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m about to head away from looking after this site for a few weeks (part vacation, part work stuff). As I contemplate some weeks away from the daily routine, I feel an urge to share some scattered thoughts about the state of LLMs and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a few early surveys on the effect AI is having on software development, is it really speeding folks up, does it improve or wreck code quality? One of the big problems with these surveys is that they aren’t taking into account &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; people are using the LLMs. From what I can tell the vast majority of LLM usage is fancy auto-complete, often using co-pilot. But those I know who get the most value from LLMs reckon that auto-complete isn’t very useful, preferring approaches that allow the LLM to directly read and edit source code files to carry out tasks. My concern is that surveys that ignore the different work-flows of using LLMs will produce data that’s going to send people down the wrong paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Another complication is the varying capabilities of different models.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m often asked, “what is the future of programming?” Should people consider entering software development now? Will LLMs eliminate the need for junior engineers? Should senior engineers get out of the profession before it’s too late? My answer to all these questions is “I haven’t the foggiest”. Furthermore I think anyone who says they know what this future will be is talking from an inappropriate orifice. We are still figuring out how to use LLMs, and it will be some time before we have a decent idea of how to use them well, especially if they gain significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I suggest, is that people experiment with them. At the least, read about what others are doing, but pay attention to the details of their workflows. Preferably experiment yourself, and do share your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄               ❇                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also asked: “is AI a bubble”? To which my answer is “OF COURSE IT’S A BUBBLE”. All major technological advances have come with economic bubbles, from canals and railroads to the internet. We know with near 100% certainty that this bubble will pop, causing lots of investments to fizzle to nothing. However what we don’t know is &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; it will pop, and thus how big the bubble will have grown, generating some real value in the process, before that happens. It could pop next month, or not for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know that when the bubble pops, many firms will go bust, but not all. When the dot-com bubble burst, it killed pets.com, it killed Webvan… but it did not kill Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202106-reducing-speaking.html"&gt;retired from public speaking&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. But while I don’t miss the stress of giving talks, I do miss hanging out with my friends in the industry. So I’m looking forward to catching up with many of them at &lt;a href="https://gotocph.com/2025"&gt;GOTO Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been involved with the GOTO conference series since the 1990s (when it was called JAOO), and continue to be impressed with how they put together a fascinating program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ✢                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My former colleague Rebecca Parsons, has been saying for a long time that hallucinations aren’t a bug of LLMs, they are a feature. Indeed they are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; feature. All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, it’s just that we find some of them useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of this is that we should always consider asking the LLM the same question more than once, perhaps with some variation in the wording. Then we can compare answers, indeed perhaps ask the LLM to compare answers for us. The difference in the answers can be as useful as the answers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly if we ever ask a hallucination engine for a numeric answer, we should ask it at least three times, so we get some sense of the variation. Furthermore we shouldn’t ask an LLM to calculate an answer than we can calculate deterministically (yes, I’ve seen this). It is OK to ask an LLM to generate code to calculate an answer (but still do it more than once).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other forms of engineering have to take into account the variability of the world. A structural engineer builds in tolerance for all the factors she can’t measure. (I remember being told early in my career that the unique characteristic of digital electronics was that there was no concept of tolerances.) Process engineers consider that humans are executing tasks, and will sometimes be forgetful or careless. Software Engineering is unusual in that it works with deterministic machines. Maybe LLMs mark the point where we join our engineering peers in a world on non-determinism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve often heard, with decent reason, an LLM compared to a junior colleague. But I find LLMs are quite happy to say “all tests green”, yet when I run them, there are failures. If that was a junior engineer’s behavior, how long would it be before H.R. was involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLMs create a huge increase in the attack surface of software systems. Simon Willison described the &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/"&gt;The Lethal Trifecta&lt;/a&gt; for AI agents: an agent that combines access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content, and a way to externally communicate (“exfiltration”). That “untrusted content” can come in all sorts of ways, ask it to read a web page, and an attacker can easily put instructions on the website in 1pt white-on-white font to trick the gullible LLM to obtain that private data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly serious when it comes to agents acting in a browser. Read an attacker’s web page, and it could trick the agent to go to your bank account in another tab and “buy you a present” by transferring your balance to the kind attacker. &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/"&gt;Willison’s view&lt;/a&gt; is that “the &lt;em&gt;entire concept&lt;/em&gt; of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common enterprise problem: crucial legacy systems become &amp;#x201C;black
      boxes&amp;#x201D;&amp;#x2014;key to operations but opaque and risky to touch. &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Thiyagu
      Palanisamy&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Chandirasekar Thiagarajan&lt;/b&gt; worked with a
      client to use AI-assisted reverse engineering to reconstruct functional
      specifications from UI elements, binaries, and data lineage to overcome
      analysis paralysis. They developed a methodical &amp;#x201C;multi-lens&amp;#x201D;
      approach&amp;#x2014;starting from visible artifacts, enriching incrementally,
      triangulating logic, and always preserving lineage. Human validation
      remains central to ensure accuracy and confidence in extracted
      functionality. This engagement revealed that turning a system from black
      box to blueprint empowers modernization decisions and accelerates
      migration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bahmni open-source hospital management system was began over nine

      &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Rahul Ramesh&lt;/b&gt; wished to convert this to use a React +

      We thought this was a conversation that others might find interesting so
      we turned it into an article. We &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html'&gt;talk about&lt;/a&gt; how programming is about both
      building and applying abstractions and how the LLM helps us in different

    <title>Bliki: Expansion Joints</title>
    <link href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExpansionJoints.html"/>
    <updated>2025-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExpansionJoints.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days when I did live talks, one of my abilities was to finish
  on time, even if my talk time was cut at the last moment (perhaps due to the
  prior speaker running over). The key to my ability to do this was to use
  Expansion Joints - parts of the talk that I'd
  pre-planned so I could cover them quickly or slowly depending on how much time
  I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I'd do this would be to plan for some topics to be optional. The
  talk would work if I skipped over them, but I could also witter on about them
  for five (or ten) minutes. Ideally, each of these topics would get one slide,
  usually with a bunch of key phrases on it - the headings of what I'd talk
  about should I be talking about it. When I got to the slide, I'd look at how
  time was going with the talk. If (as was usually the case) I was running short
  of time, I could cover the slide in about thirty seconds, saying something
  like: “in doing this, there's a bunch of things you need to consider, but they
  are out of scope for today's talk”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, I did have time, I could then spend some time talking about
  them. The slide would be simple, and not provide much of a &lt;a href="/bliki/VisualChannel.html"&gt;Visual Channel&lt;/a&gt;, but that wasn't so important, after all this material
  was optional in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single flex-slide was my favorite Expansion Joint, as it was easy to
  use. Sometimes however my optional topic required a proper visual channel,
  necessitating dedicated slides. My solution here was good control over
  slide handling. Presentation tools include the ability to skip over slides
  while I'm talking, and I made sure I practiced how to use them so I could skip
  a bunch of slides without the audience knowing. It's crucial here that it's
  invisible to the audience, I find it looks sloppy if anyone says “in the
  interests of time I'll skip over these slides”. To do this, however, I do need
  access to my laptop while presenting, venues that only provide a clicker while
  loading the slides on some other machine lack that control. That started to
  happen in my last couple of years, much to my annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating talks, I was always worried that I would run out of things to
  say, even though experience told me I reliably crammed more stuff in than I
  could possibly cover. Expansion Joints helped with this, I could aggressively
  trim the core talk to less than I needed, and rely on the Expansion Joints to
  fill the gap. In practice I usually didn't need the Expansion Joints anyway, but
  their presence helped my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Expansion Joints was particularly important for me as I never
  rehearsed my talks. I was always someone whose ability to present was driven by
  adrenaline. Talking to a rubber duck just didn't work, the duck was clearly
  every bit as bored as I was. Consequently the first time I gave a talk, I was
  hazy as to how long it would take. Yet with Expansion Joints in place, I was
  able to finish a talk right on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expansion Joints enabled me to give the same talk
  to different time slots. Sometimes I'd have thirty minutes, sometimes
  forty-five. With Expansion Joints, I didn't need to change my slides,
  particularly handy if a time cut (or more rarely a time increase) appeared at the
  last moment. (Although in my later years, I handled this by doing a &lt;a href="/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html"&gt;Suite Of Talks&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks that encourage audience interaction need these because we can never
  predict how much time the interaction will use up. Sometimes we get a steady
  stream of questions, other times (particularly in Scandinavia, or
  upper-Midwest America) a lack of questions had me blasting through the agenda.
  Any such talk needed a double-dose of this temporal ballast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expansion Joints are at their most useful in later parts of the talk, as
  it's then that I have the most information on how much time I have. Earlier
  ones can still be handy, particularly if they come after an interactive
  section when I'd like to rebase my timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name was coined by Neal Ford, Matthew McCullough, and Nathaniel
    Schutta in their excellent book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321820800/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321820800&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20"&gt;Presentation Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs have become a popular way to connect strategy with execution in
      large organizations. But when they are set in a top&amp;#x2011;down cascade, they
      often lose their meaning. Teams receive objectives they didn&amp;#x2019;t help
      create, and the result is weak commitment and little real change.
      &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Paulo Caroli&lt;/b&gt; describes how 
      high&amp;#x2011;performing teams can work in another way. They define their own
      objectives in an organization that uses a collaborative process to align
      the team&amp;#x2019;s OKRs with the broader strategy. With these Team OKRs in place,
      they create a shared purpose and become the base for a regular cycle of
      planning, check&amp;#x2011;ins, and retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <author>
      <name>Martin Fowler</name>
      <email>martin@martinfowler.com</email>
      <uri>https://martinfowler.com</uri>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abi Noda&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358495366930976769/"&gt;observes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just met with a 2000+ eng company. Their developers are saving 2+ hours per week thanks to Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But they’re also losing:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3 hrs per week due to slow builds&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4 hrs per week on dev environment toil&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 hrs per week waiting for code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;AI is not a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nik Malykhin&lt;/strong&gt; found it useful to get an AI assistant to &lt;a href="https://nik1379616.substack.com/p/can-we-make-ai-code-assistants-smarter"&gt;write its own coding rules&lt;/a&gt; by analyzing his code, and then asking it to refine them as worked with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the central paradox of using AI assistants effectively: to offload cognitive work to an AI, you must first do the meta-cognitive work of codifying your own development philosophy and collaboration style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;strong&gt;Charity Majors&lt;/strong&gt;  that there is a valuable distinction between &lt;a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/disposable-code-is-here-to-stay"&gt;disposable versus durable code&lt;/a&gt;, and that makes a difference in how we use AI with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The difference between disposable code and durable code is not about whether the code was generated by AI or written by a human, or even how difficult it was to write. The cost is defined by the standards you are building to, and the rest of the software development lifecycle: how well you expect to maintain it, extend it, migrate it, understand its behavior, or fix it when it breaks. This is the expensive part of software development, the type that requires deep expertise and familiarity with your language and environment. Disposable code is cheap because you don’t even try to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Highsmith&lt;/strong&gt; thinks that we should think of AI as &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/alternative-intelligence-naming-mind-weve-actually-built-highsmith-doi4c/"&gt;Alternative Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not fake intelligence, or artificial empathy, or HAL 9000 with manners. It’s something else. Something that thinks differently, not defectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rod Johnson&lt;/strong&gt; asserts that we know that memory is important to AI systems, but we forget that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@springrod/on-memory-why-ai-agents-risk-forgetting-what-business-already-knows-51b2c902e91c"&gt;Domain Models are an important form of memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Event Sourcing provides perfect episodic memory by storing the complete history of domain changes as immutable events. Every decision, every state transition, every business event is preserved with full context.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Repository patterns offer domain-focused memory interfaces that understand business concepts. A CustomerRepository knows how to retrieve customer information in ways that preserve business meaning, not just raw data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bounded contexts from Domain-Driven Design partition memory into semantic boundaries, preventing the concept pollution that plagues pure vector-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aggregates function as cohesive memory clusters with consistency boundaries—exactly what we need for reliable agent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      experiments&lt;/a&gt; we did to explore how far Generative AI can currently
      be pushed toward autonomously developing high-quality, up-to-date software
      without human intervention. As a test case, we created an agentic workflow
      to build a simple Spring Boot application end to end. We found that the
      workflow could ultimately generate these simple applications, but still
      observed significant issues in the results&amp;#x2014;especially as we increased the
      complexity. The model would generate features we hadn't asked for, make
      shifting assumptions around gaps in the requirements, and declare success
      even when tests were failing. We concluded that while many of our
      strategies &amp;#x2014; such as reusable prompts or a reference application &amp;#x2014; are
      valuable for enhancing AI-assisted workflows, a human in the loop to
      supervise generation remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Matteo Vaccari&lt;/b&gt; shows why the common metric of AI code
      acceptance has big hole. An LLM &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/partner-with-ai-and-throw-away-the-code.html'&gt;can be helpful&lt;/a&gt; even if you throw away its
      code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;It's become a common habit for developers to give Large Language Models
      (LLMs) a persona when working with them. I &lt;a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/who-is-llm.html'&gt;describe four of them&lt;/a&gt;, a
      stubborn donkey, a genie, a slot machine, and Uriah Heep.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Korny Sietsma has a &lt;a href="https://blog.korny.info/2025/07/18/a-real-world-ai-coding-case-sample"&gt;great example&lt;/a&gt; of how using an LLM for coding is very helpful but with limitations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://blog.korny.info/2025/07/19/clowns-to-the-left-of-me"&gt;thoughtful general essay&lt;/a&gt; on why the hype and the immovable skeptics are both missing the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While here, a professor of poetry &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/opinion/ai-chatgpt-school.html?unlocked_article_code=1.YE8.FbMs.W6XRxpJ6UEyg&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;ponders&lt;/a&gt; (gift link) on the value and limits of AI with writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the real challenges here is the way that A.I. undermines the human value of attention, and the individuality that flows from that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What we stand to lose is not just a skill but a mode of being: the pleasure of invention, the felt life of the mind at work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three articles I enjoyed yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2025/07/09/promiscuity-of-modern-developers/"&gt;Stephen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; talks about how Gen AI tools break two common constants with developer tools: they are willing to flit between Gen AI tools and they are willing to pay for them. This implies that it’s not too late for new tools to appear, and that enterprise adoption will be slowed by a lack of consensus on which direction to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/06/26/leading-your-engineers-towards-an-ai-assisted-future/"&gt;Pete Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; continues his excellent writing on Gen AI by proposing an approach to leading engineers towards an AI-assisted future, centered around a the concept of aligned autonomy. He advocates an explicit experimentation phase, followed by supporting adoption and measuring their impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://charity.wtf/2025/07/09/thoughts-on-motivation-and-my-40-year-career/"&gt;Charity Majors&lt;/a&gt; reflects on her career. I really resonated with her words: “I think I’m less interested in my own happiness (whatever that means) than I am interested in &lt;em&gt;doing work that feels worth doing&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I still care about the code</title>

&lt;p&gt;Even with LLMs, &lt;b class = 'author'&gt;Birgitta B&amp;#xF6;ckeler&lt;/b&gt; still cares about
      the code: “LLMs are NOT compilers, interpreters, transpilers or assemblers
      of natural language, they are &lt;b&gt;inferrers&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
