<p>We&#8217;ve talked a lot about Masonry layout here on CSS-Tricks, so there&#8217;s no need to remind you of the two-sided discussions about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/csswg-minutes-telecon-2024-12-04-just-use-grid-vs-display-masonry/">how to approach it</a>, the idea of using it <a href="https://css-tricks.com/masonry-watching-a-css-feature-evolve/">as a new unifying layout concept</a>, or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/making-a-masonry-layout-that-works-today/">alternative approaches for making it work today</a>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what you do need to know: it&#8217;s going to be <strong><code>display: grid-lanes</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The earliest talks concerning masonry began in 2017 when&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945" rel="noopener">Rachel Andrew expressed some concerns about how to make a Pinterest masonry layout</a>. Rachel said it felt like the right approach should be a flexbox kind of thing, but this wasn’t fully achievable with flexbox, as items would rather flow from top-to-bottom rather than across each row:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Currently the closest you can get with CSS to this type of layout is to use <code>multi-col</code> however, the items then flow top to bottom rather than across the rows.</p>



<p>This feels more like a behaviour of flexbox than grid, as the solution is very much based on the size of the items. Opening this in order to record the feature request/use case for future discussion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And so, the talks surrounding masonry layout in CSS began within the W3C. In that same GitHub thread, you’ll read that <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-274621588" rel="noopener">Tab Atkins-Bittner</a> shared a &#8220;hacky&#8221; way to go about it with CSS Grid.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You can have Grid do Masonry if you know the heights of the items ahead of time. It&#8217;s a bit hacky, but you set the grid container to&nbsp;<code>grid: auto-flow dense 1px / &lt;column widths here&gt;;</code>, then set each item to grid-row: span&nbsp;<code>&lt;pixel height as integer&gt;;</code>&nbsp;(for example, if the item is 50px tall, use&nbsp;<code>grid-row: span 50;</code>).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’m a sucker for clever CSS hacks, but you know what else I’m a sucker for? A working CSS solution that makes it easier for beginners to use. And no, unfortunately, we cannot use&nbsp;<code>grid-template-rows</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>grid-template-columns</code>,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-311091451" rel="noopener">Nate Green suggested</a> in the same thread:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="5"><code markup="tt">.figure-list {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: flow;
}</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-319921105" rel="noopener">Atkins-Bittner replied</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There&#8217;s no &#8220;simple&#8221; way to adapt Grid into Masonry &#8211; anything would involve non-trivial edits to the layout algorithm. Packery, in particular, really needs things to have a defined width.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Okay, that’s fine. I’m sure you’d be thinking as well, “why not create a new <code>display</code> property for it?” Well, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-319994626" rel="noopener">Rachel added</a> that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The thing is we can&#8217;t create a brand new value of display for every distinct design pattern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mind you, all these discussions were happening as far back as 2017, meaning masonry has been an elusive goal for quite some time.</p>



<p>Just to make sure you’re with me, this is an example image of the kind of layout masonry looks like (thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-321411718" rel="noopener">Michael Richins for this</a>):</p>

<p>One thing I would like is that prior to the announcement of masonry display type, there were solutions/hacks discussed,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-334962477" rel="noopener">like this one from Andy Barefoot</a>, but nothing truly was decided as the main go-to feature for CSS masonry. Hey, there was even a super cool&nbsp;<a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" rel="noopener">Masonry library</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/desandro" rel="noopener">David DeSandro</a>, and he gave&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-432658269" rel="noopener">pretty useful advice to W3C</a>&nbsp;and browser vendors when writing the spec and implementing the masonry layout, like on how loading images would work, multi-column spanning items, filling gaps, retaining horizontal order.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wBGNqJK" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/wBGNqJK?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wBGNqJK&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wBGNqJK" title="CodePen Embed wBGNqJK" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p class="is-style-explanation">Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" rel="noopener">Masonry.js docs</a>&nbsp;for more information about the object options.</p>



<p>This thread helped,&nbsp;<strong>but it still didn’t lead to a conclusive statement</strong>&nbsp;about what the masonry syntax will look like. In fact, we had code suggestions, like from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-334448407" rel="noopener">Dan Tonon</a>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="4-5"><code markup="tt">.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-block-count: 2; 
  flex-block-flow: cross; 
}</code></pre>



<p>This introduces two new flexbox properties called&nbsp;<code>flex-block-count</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>flex-block-flow</code>&nbsp;which allows us to control items similarly (with <code>column-count</code>) and control the flow of items, respectively. However, this wouldn&#8217;t fly as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-334483625" rel="noopener">Michael Richins pointed out</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This will still not work for children of different height&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This thread was not going anywhere, so discussions ended in April 2020 with a GitHub user with the name&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-611247371" rel="noopener">Nic787 referencing and agreeing with an earlier</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-611247371" rel="noopener"><em>probable</em></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/945#issuecomment-611247371" rel="noopener">solution</a>&nbsp;for masonry using&nbsp;<code>float</code>&nbsp;instead of grid.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I think you have a good point. Currently, float is becoming old and flexbox allow a lot of things to be done, but this masonry layout is lacking in both.</p>



<p>… Sometimes you can have lot of small images in a row, so making it left to right can&#8217;t work all the time. Masonry is left to right like always, but in a way it&#8217;s easier for the user to access informations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20sort%3Acreated-asc%20masonry" rel="noopener">Fortunately, discussions still continued in many threads,</a>&nbsp;and the requests for the masonry display property flooded W3C. Another notable GitHub thread that surfaced on the masonry debate is, well, the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243" rel="noopener">Masonry Syntax Debate</a>&nbsp;in November 2024, but that also didn’t lead to much&nbsp;<em><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2518124401" rel="noopener">at that point</a></em>. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2518124401" rel="noopener">Jen Simmons noted in the meeting</a>&nbsp;that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Personally disappointed that we&#8217;re not making more progress. We&#8217;ve been having this argument for 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five years of back and forth on how exactly the naming and structure would be. Do we use grid? Do we use a brand new property? Do we create separate properties just for masonry? We couldn’t really decide on that.</p>



<p>One thing I like to get behind is a comment from our very own&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/monknow/">Juan Diego</a>, stating how&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2524100674" rel="noopener">solutions aren&#8217;t “just use grid” or create a new property</a>, but that we could get rid of the&nbsp;<code>grid-</code>&nbsp;prefix altogether and settle for an option that caters for both&nbsp;<code>grid</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>masonry</code>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>…it should be possible to use a new unprefixed&nbsp;<code>template-areas</code>&nbsp;property for masonry and grid, regardless of the formatting context..</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fortunately, something good came out of that thread because&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2627998471" rel="noopener">another meeting</a>&nbsp;was held on January 31st of 2025, and guess what? It was resolved to reuse grid templating and placement properties for masonry layout.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The CSS Working Group just discussed&nbsp;<code>[css-grid-3][masonry] Masonry Syntax Debate</code>, and agreed to the following: RESOLVED: Re-use grid templating and placement properties for masonry layout.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wait. Why am I announcing about masonry syntax properties? What about the main syntax itself? Isn’t that why we’re here? Awesome, you’re still with me. So let me show you the exact thread where the masonry syntax war ended.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-s-here-almost-">It’s (almost) here!</h3>


<p>This brings us to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12022#issuecomment-3525043825" rel="noopener">latest announcement</a> that&nbsp;setting&nbsp;<code>grid-lanes</code>&nbsp;on the <code>display</code> property activates a masonry layout.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.masonry {
  display: grid-lanes;
}</code></pre>



<p>It was tough to get here. Deciding on the keyword alone took <em>years</em>. Just <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12022#issue-2956927327" rel="noopener">look at all of the names</a> that were considered leading up to <code>grid-lanes</code>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><code>collapsed-grid</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>grid collapse</code></li>



<li><code>grid-stack</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>stacked-grid</code></li>



<li><code>grid-pack</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>packed-grid</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>grid pack</code></li>



<li><code>compact-grid</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>compact grid</code></li>



<li><code>grid-masonry</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>masonry-grid</code></li>



<li><code>grid-flex</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>flex-grid</code></li>



<li><code>grid single-axis</code>&nbsp;(masonry grid) vs.&nbsp;<code>grid dual-axis</code>&nbsp;(normal grid)</li>



<li><code>grid stack</code>&nbsp;(masonry grid) vs.&nbsp;<code>grid grid</code>&nbsp;(normal grid)</li>



<li><code>staggered-grid</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>grid staggered</code></li>



<li><code>uneven-grid</code></li>



<li><code>semi-grid</code></li>



<li><code>lane-grid</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>grid-lanes</code></li>



<li><code>axial-grid</code></li>
</ul>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have minded&nbsp;<code>staggered-grid</code>&nbsp;since that’s what it is in React Native. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/kevinpowell/">Kevin Powell</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12022#issuecomment-3334326242" rel="noopener">agreed</a>. That said, I am perfectly okay with <code>grid-lanes</code>. It will take some time for browsers to implement it, as discussions surrounding the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12023" rel="noopener">shorthand adjustments for masonry are still going on</a>, with nothing much said on the issue just yet.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-item-flow">What about Item Flow?</h3>


<p>Oh yeah, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/quick-hit-42/">remember that</a>? It&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2584991716" rel="noopener">still in the works</a>, and I expect that we&#8217;ll see it after a proper <code>grid-lanes</code> implementation starts making the rounds. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11243#issuecomment-2584991716" rel="noopener">There&#8217;s a nice hypothetical example from Fantasai</a> illustrating how it might look if added to the spec today:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">item-flow: &lt;item-direction> || &lt;item-wrap> || &lt;item-pack> || &lt;item-slack>

/* shorthand for */
item-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse
item-wrap: wrap | wrap-reverse
item-pack: normal | dense || collapse
item-slack: &lt;length-percentage></code></pre>



<p>In use, it would look something along the lines of:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="5"><code markup="tt">.masonry {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(14rem, 1fr));
  item-flow: collapse; /* == item-flow: row collapse 1em; */
  gap: 1rem;
}</code></pre>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-test-run-of-masonry-layout">So, what&#8217;s next?</h3>


<p>After many back-and-forths, <s>masonry</s> <code>grid-lanes</code> is here! But where exactly?</p>



<p>Well, this is the awkward part. The truth is we&#8217;ll still have to wait for browsers to implement <code>grid-lanes</code>. How long may it take? I really can&#8217;t say, but take into consideration that all major browsers already have implemented some type of masonry layout behind flags or previews, but<strong> </strong>with different syntaxes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Chrome and Edge teams initially <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/masonry-update#test-css-masonry" rel="noopener">implemented Masonry</a> in Chromium 140 as <code>display: masonry</code> but are already working on switching to <code>grid-lanes</code>. Some of <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos/tree/main/css-masonry" rel="noopener">their demos</a> already reflect it.</li>



<li>The WebKit team <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/16026/css-masonry-syntax/#the-remaining-debate-over-syntax" rel="noopener">implemented masonry</a> in Safari 17 as <code>display: grid</code>, but they <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=302618" rel="noopener">already seem to have some work</a> on <code>grid-lanes</code> in the pipelines.</li>



<li>The Mozilla team was actually the first browser to implement masonry layout in 2020 — using <code>display: grid</code> as well. But like the others, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2002087" rel="noopener">they&#8217;re already in the process</a> of making the switch to <code>grid-lanes</code>.</li>
</ul>



<p>So, good news all around! All that&#8217;s left is to wait. If you want to track <code>grid-lanes</code> progress, here is a good <a href="https://patrickbrosset.com/lab/css-masonry-resources/" rel="noopener">link pool for each browser</a> from Patrick Brosset. And, if you can&#8217;t wait for the official masonry implementation, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/making-a-masonry-layout-that-works-today/">Zell Liew has an approach</a> for using it today, with minimal JavaScript.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have to search for articles often on this site.  And I&#8217;d say searching this site is Pretty OK&#x2122; in general. Making content searchable on a site with 18+ years of published content is gonna be challenging no matter what, and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/jetpack-instant-search/">the Jetpack Search tool we use</a> is darned good considering it&#8217;s a drop-in solution.</p>



<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s a bit heavy-handed when all I really need is a quick URL I can copy-paste into some other article I&#8217;m working on. What would be cool is a search straight from my local machine which is totally possible by fetching the content from the WordPress REST API that runs under the hood of this site.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what <a href="https://www.raycast.com/j3lte" rel="noopener">Jelte Lagendijk</a> built for Raycast, a &#8220;shortcut-all the-things&#8221; app for macOS and Windows. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.raycast.com/j3lte/css-tricks" rel="noopener">little extension</a> where you simply type and a get a solid set of real-time results.</p>

<p>Ready for the second part? If you recall, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-list-of-avatars-using-modern-css-part-1/">last time</a> we worked on a responsive list of overlapping avatar images featuring a cut-out between them.</p>



<span id="more-390660"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1009" height="324" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x9Wvyg6Oz6-1009.png?resize=1009%2C324" alt="Two rows of circular avatar images. The images overlap with one another. The first row has eight images; the second row has six images." class="wp-image-390576" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x9Wvyg6Oz6-1009.png?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x9Wvyg6Oz6-1009.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x9Wvyg6Oz6-1009.png?resize=768%2C247&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>We are still creating a responsive list of avatars, but this time it will be a circular list.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1070" height="476" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/luZQsrO2qg-1070.png?resize=1070%2C476&#038;ssl=1" alt="Showing two examples of circular avatar images arranged in a circle. The first example has eight images. The second example has six images." class="wp-image-390669" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/luZQsrO2qg-1070.png?w=1070&amp;ssl=1 1070w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/luZQsrO2qg-1070.png?resize=300%2C133&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/luZQsrO2qg-1070.png?resize=1024%2C456&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/luZQsrO2qg-1070.png?resize=768%2C342&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>This design is less common than the horizontal list, but it’s still a good exercise to explore new CSS tricks.</p>



<p>Let’s start with a demo. You can resize it and see how the images behave, and also hover them to get a cool reveal effect.</p>



<p class="is-style-explanation">The following demo is currently limited to Chrome and Edge, but will work in other browsers as the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/"><code>sibling-index()</code></a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/"><code>sibling-count()</code></a> functions gain broader support. You can track Firefox support in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1953973" rel="noopener">Ticket #1953973</a> and WebKit’s position in <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/471" rel="noopener">Issue #471</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_MYyobpb" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYyobpb?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=MYyobpb&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed MYyobpb" title="CodePen Embed MYyobpb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>We will rely on the same HTML structure and CSS base as the example we covered in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-list-of-avatars-using-modern-css-part-1/">Part 1</a>: a list of images inside a container with <code>mask</code>-ed cutouts. This time, however, the positions will be different.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="responsive-list-of-avatars-using-modern-css">Responsive List of Avatars Using Modern CSS</h4>


<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-list-of-avatars-using-modern-css-part-1/">Horizontal Lists</a></strong></li>



<li><strong>Circular Lists</strong> <em>(<em>You are here!</em>)</em></li>
</ol>
</div></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="placing-images-around-a-circle">Placing Images Around a Circle</h3>


<p>There are several techniques <a href="https://css-tip.com/images-circle/" rel="noopener">for placing images around a circle</a>. I will start with my favorite one, which is less known but uses a simple code that relies on the CSS <code>offset</code> property.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
}
.container img {
  grid-area: 1/1;
  offset: circle(180px) calc(100%*sibling-index()/sibling-count()) 0deg;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_myeeMMQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/myeeMMQ?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=myeeMMQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed myeeMMQ" title="CodePen Embed myeeMMQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The code doesn’t look super intuitive, but its logic is fairly straightforward. The <code>offset</code> property is a shorthand, so let’s write it the longhand way to see how breaks down:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">offset-path: circle(180px);
offset-distance: calc(100%*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
offset-rotate: 0deg;</code></pre>



<p>We define a path to be a circle with a radius of <code>180px</code>. All the images will “follow” that path, but will initially be on top of each other. We need to adjust their distance to change their position along the path (i.e., the circle). That’s where <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/offset-distance/"><code>offset-distance</code></a> comes into play, which we combine with the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/"><code>sibling-index()</code></a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/"><code>sibling-count()</code></a> functions to create code that works with any number of elements instead of working with exact numbers.</p>



<p>For six elements, the values will be as follows:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">100% x 1/6 = 16.67%
100% x 2/6 = 33.33%
100% x 3/6 = 50%
100% x 4/6 = 66,67%
100% x 5/6 = 83.33%
100% x 6/6 = 100%</code></pre>



<p>This will place the elements evenly around the circle. To this, we add a rotation equal to <code>0deg</code> using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/offset-rotate/"><code>offset-rotate</code></a> to keep the elements straight so they don’t rotate as they follow the circular path. From there, all we have to do is update the circle’s radius with the value we want.</p>



<p>That’s my preferred approach, but there is a second one that uses the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/"><code>transform</code></a> property to combine two rotations with a translation:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
}
.container img {
  grid-area: 1/1;
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
  transform: rotate(calc(-1*var(--_i))) translate(180px) rotate(var(--_i));
}</code></pre>



<p>The translation contains the circle radius value and the rotations use generic code that relies on the <code>sibling-*</code> functions the same way we did with <code>offset-distance</code>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_bNpoYYp/7782dfd8b0bbc6889e44ed776aee16b0" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/bNpoYYp/7782dfd8b0bbc6889e44ed776aee16b0?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bNpoYYp/7782dfd8b0bbc6889e44ed776aee16b0&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed bNpoYYp/7782dfd8b0bbc6889e44ed776aee16b0" title="CodePen Embed bNpoYYp/7782dfd8b0bbc6889e44ed776aee16b0" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Even though I prefer the first approach, I will rely on the second one because it allows me to reuse the rotation angle in more places.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-responsive-part">The Responsive Part</h3>


<p>Similar to the horizontal responsive list from the last article, I will rely on container query units to define the radius of the circle and make the component responsive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="923" height="522" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/s_8EB8676D2975C0D299467954CBB131676699FF18C298A3FD9090F0DFBEACB674_1763724280412_image.png?resize=923%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt="Diagram of eight circular avatar images arranged around a circle.

<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  --s: 120px; /* image size */

  aspect-ratio: 1;
  container-type: inline-size;
}
.container img {
  width: var(--s);
  --_r: calc(50cqw - var(--s)/2);
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
  transform: rotate(calc(-1*var(--_i))) translate(var(--_r)) rotate(var(--_i));
}</code></pre>



<p>Resize the container in the demo below and see how the images behave:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_raeGpMQ/0786e1ffe2d08aff377d1ae7e94591cc" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/raeGpMQ/0786e1ffe2d08aff377d1ae7e94591cc?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=raeGpMQ/0786e1ffe2d08aff377d1ae7e94591cc&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed raeGpMQ/0786e1ffe2d08aff377d1ae7e94591cc" title="CodePen Embed raeGpMQ/0786e1ffe2d08aff377d1ae7e94591cc" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>It’s responsive, but when the container gets bigger, the images are too spread out, and I don’t like that. It would be good to keep them as close as possible. In other words, we consider the smallest circle that contains all the images without overlap.</p>



<p>Remember what we did in the first part: we added a maximum boundary to the margin for a similar reason. We will do the same thing here:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">--_r: min(50cqw - var(--s)/2, R);</code></pre>



<p>I know you don’t want a boring geometry lesson, so I will skip it and give you the value of <code>R</code>:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">S/(2 x sin(.5turn/N))</code></pre>



<p>Written in CSS:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">--_r: min(50cqw - var(--s)/2,var(--s)/(2*sin(.5turn/sibling-count())));</code></pre>



<p>Now, when you make the container bigger, the images will stay close to each other, which is perfect:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_zxqEpdX/5acbd51a459838ee9ab007318a04faab" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/zxqEpdX/5acbd51a459838ee9ab007318a04faab?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=zxqEpdX/5acbd51a459838ee9ab007318a04faab&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed zxqEpdX/5acbd51a459838ee9ab007318a04faab" title="CodePen Embed zxqEpdX/5acbd51a459838ee9ab007318a04faab" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Let’s introduce another variable for the gap between images (<code>--g</code>) and update the formula slightly to keep a small gap between the images.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  --s: 120px; /* image size */
  --g: 10px;  /* the gap */

  aspect-ratio: 1;
  container-type: inline-size;
}
.container img {
  width: var(--s);
  --_r: min(50cqw - var(--s)/2,(var(--s) + var(--g))/(2*sin(.5turn/sibling-count())));
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cut-out-effect">The Cut-Out Effect</h3>


<p>For this part, we will be using the same mask that we used in the last article:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at X Y, #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)), #000);</code></pre>



<p>With the horizontal list, the values of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> were quite simple. We didn’t have to define <code>Y</code> since its default value did the job, and the <code>X</code> value was either <code>150% + M</code> or <code>-50% - M</code>, with <code>M</code> being the margin that controls the overlap. Seen differently, <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are the coordinates of the center point of the next or previous image in the list.</p>



<p>That’s still the case this time around, but the value is trickier to calculate:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="911" height="477" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/s_8EB8676D2975C0D299467954CBB131676699FF18C298A3FD9090F0DFBEACB674_1763729635507_image.png?resize=911%2C477&#038;ssl=1" alt="Diagram of eight circular avatar images arranged around a circle.

<p>The idea is to start from the center of the current image (<code>50% 50%</code>) and move to the center of the next image (<code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>). I will first follow segment A to reach the center of the big circle and then follow segment B to reach the center of the next image.</p>



<p>This is the formula:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">X = 50% - Ax + Bx
Y = 50% - Ay + By</code></pre>



<p><code>Ax</code> and <code>Ay</code> are the projections of the segment A on the X-axis and the Y-axis. We can use trigonometric functions to get the values.</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">Ax = r x sin(i);
Ay = r x cos(i);</code></pre>



<p>The <code>r</code> represents the circle’s radius defined by the CSS variable <code>--_r</code>, and <code>i</code> represents the angle of rotation defined by the CSS variable <code>--_i</code>.</p>



<p>Same logic with the B segment:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">Bx = r x sin(j);
By = r x cos(j);</code></pre>



<p>The <code>j</code> is similar to <code>i</code>, but for the <em>next</em> image in the sequence, meaning we increment the index by 1. That gives us the following CSS calculations for each variable:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">--_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
--_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count());</code></pre>



<p>And the final code with the mask:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  --s: 120px; /* image size */
  --g: 14px;  /* the gap */

  aspect-ratio: 1;
  container-type: inline-size;
}
.container img {
  width: var(--s);
  --_r: min(50cqw - var(--s)/2,(var(--s) + var(--g))/(2*sin(.5turn/sibling-count())));
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count());
  transform: rotate(calc(-1*var(--_i))) translate(var(--_r)) rotate(var(--_i));
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at
    calc(50% + var(--_r)*(cos(var(--_j)) - cos(var(--_i))))
    calc(50% + var(--_r)*(sin(var(--_i)) - sin(var(--_j)))),
      #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)), #000);
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_EaKwEdp/300cd27415c317baca7197441c8090d3" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/EaKwEdp/300cd27415c317baca7197441c8090d3?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=EaKwEdp/300cd27415c317baca7197441c8090d3&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed EaKwEdp/300cd27415c317baca7197441c8090d3" title="CodePen Embed EaKwEdp/300cd27415c317baca7197441c8090d3" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Cool, right? You might notice two different implementations for the cut-out. The formula I used previously considered the next image, but if we consider the <em>previous</em> image instead, the cut-out goes in another direction. So, rather than incrementing the index, we decrement instead and assign it to a <code>.reverse</code> class that we can use when we want the cut-out to go in the opposite direction:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img {
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count());
}
.container.reverse img {
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() - 1)/sibling-count());
}</code></pre>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-animation-part">The Animation Part</h3>


<p>Similar to what we did in the last article, the goal of this animation is to remove the overlap when an image is hovered to fully reveal it. In the horizontal list, we simply set its <code>margin</code> property to <code>0</code>, and we adjust the margin of the other images to prevent overflow.</p>



<p>This time, the logic is different. We will rotate all of the images except the hovered one until the hovered image is fully visible. The direction of the rotation will depend on the cut-out direction, of course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1026" height="390" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/s_8EB8676D2975C0D299467954CBB131676699FF18C298A3FD9090F0DFBEACB674_1763736360335_image.png?resize=1026%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="Eight avatar images arranged around a circle.

<p>To rotate the image, we need to update the <code>--_i</code> variable, which is used as an argument for the rotate function. Let’s start with an arbitrary value for the rotation, say <code>20deg</code>.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
}
.container:has(:hover) img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() + 20deg);
}
.container.reverse:has(:hover) img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() - 20deg);
}</code></pre>



<p>Now, when an image is hovered, all of images rotate by <code>20deg</code>. Try it out in the following demo.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_vEGejeK/2f2d034dd0f1a7a43b1a6aeefe3a1a0b" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/vEGejeK/2f2d034dd0f1a7a43b1a6aeefe3a1a0b?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vEGejeK/2f2d034dd0f1a7a43b1a6aeefe3a1a0b&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed vEGejeK/2f2d034dd0f1a7a43b1a6aeefe3a1a0b" title="CodePen Embed vEGejeK/2f2d034dd0f1a7a43b1a6aeefe3a1a0b" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Hmm, the images do indeed rotate, but the mask is not following along. Don’t forget that the mask considers the position of the next or previous image defined by <code>--_j</code> and the next/previous image is rotating — hence we need to also update the <code>--_j</code> variable when the hover happens.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="10,14"><code markup="tt">.container img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count());
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count());
}
.container.reverse img {
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() - 1)/sibling-count());
}
.container:has(:hover) img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() + 20deg);
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count() + 20deg);
}
.container.reverse:has(:hover) img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() - 20deg);
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() - 1)/sibling-count() - 20deg);
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s a lot of redundant code. Let’s optimize it a little by defining additional variables:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img {
  --_a: 20deg;

  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() + var(--_ii, 0deg));
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() + 1)/sibling-count() + var(--_jj, 0deg));
}
.container.reverse img {
  --_i: calc(1turn*sibling-index()/sibling-count() - var(--_ii, 0deg));
  --_j: calc(1turn*(sibling-index() - 1)/sibling-count() - var(--_jj, 0deg));
}
.container:has(:hover) img {
  --_ii: var(--_a);
  --_jj: var(--_a);
}</code></pre>



<p>Now the angle (<code>--_a</code>) is defined in one place, and I consider two intermediate variables to add an offset to the <code>--_i</code> and <code>--_j</code> variables.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_raeGvvb/26ac00476a5535c8b0afd12295c32474" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/raeGvvb/26ac00476a5535c8b0afd12295c32474?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=raeGvvb/26ac00476a5535c8b0afd12295c32474&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed raeGvvb/26ac00476a5535c8b0afd12295c32474" title="CodePen Embed raeGvvb/26ac00476a5535c8b0afd12295c32474" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The rotation of all the images is now perfect. Let’s disable the rotation of the hovered image:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img:hover {
  --_ii: 0deg;
  --_jj: 0deg;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_raeGvrg/906d36d7573a8de7a91215be6e641148" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/raeGvrg/906d36d7573a8de7a91215be6e641148?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=raeGvrg/906d36d7573a8de7a91215be6e641148&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed raeGvrg/906d36d7573a8de7a91215be6e641148" title="CodePen Embed raeGvrg/906d36d7573a8de7a91215be6e641148" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Oops, the mask is off again! Do you see the issue?</p>



<p>We want to stop the hovered image from rotating while allowing the rest of the images to rotate. Therefore, the <code>--_j</code> variable of the hovered image needs to update since it’s linked to the next or previous image. So we should remove <code>--_jj: 0deg</code> and keep only <code>--_ii: 0deg</code>.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img:hover {
  --_ii: 0deg;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_dPMVeQX/48492d73fd15f85c023af469786c6c5f" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/dPMVeQX/48492d73fd15f85c023af469786c6c5f?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=dPMVeQX/48492d73fd15f85c023af469786c6c5f&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed dPMVeQX/48492d73fd15f85c023af469786c6c5f" title="CodePen Embed dPMVeQX/48492d73fd15f85c023af469786c6c5f" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>That’s a little better. We fixed the cut-out effect on the hovered image, but the overall effect is still not perfect. Let’s not forget that the hovered image is either the next or previous image of another image, and since it’s not rotating, another <code>--_j</code> variable needs to remain unchanged.</p>



<p>For the first list, it’s the variable of the previous image that should remain unchanged. For the second list, it’s the variable of the next image:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* select previous element of hovered */
.container:not(.reverse) img:has(+ :hover),
/* select next element of hovered */
.container.reverse img:hover + * {
  --_jj: 0deg;
}</code></pre>



<p>In case you are wondering how I knew to do this, well, I tried both ways and I picked the one that worked. It was either the code above or this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container:not(.reverse) img:hover + *,
.container.reverse img:has(+ :hover) {
  --_jj: 0deg;
}</code></pre>

<p>We are getting closer! All the images behave correctly except for one in each list. Try hovering all of them to identify the culprit.</p>



<p>Can you figure out what we are missing? Think a moment about it.</p>



<p>Our list is circular, but the HTML code is not, so even if the first and last images are visually placed next to each other, in the code, they are not. We cannot link both of them using the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/adjacent-sibling/">adjacent sibling selector</a> (<code>+</code>). We need two more selectors to cover those edge cases:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container.reverse:has(:last-child:hover) img:first-child,
.container:not(.reverse):has(:first-child:hover) img:last-child {

<p>Oof! We have fixed all the issues, and now our hover effect is great, but it’s still not perfect. Now, instead of using an arbitrary value for the rotation, we need to be accurate. We have to find the smallest value that removes the overlap while keeping the images as close as possible.</p>

<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GgZMYPY/e9095c9c4e5221281a653f9577765007" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GgZMYPY/e9095c9c4e5221281a653f9577765007?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GgZMYPY/e9095c9c4e5221281a653f9577765007&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GgZMYPY/e9095c9c4e5221281a653f9577765007" title="CodePen Embed GgZMYPY/e9095c9c4e5221281a653f9577765007" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Now we can say everything is perfect!</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>


<p>This one was a bit tough, right? Don’t worry if you got a bit lost with all the complex formulas. They are very specific to this example, so even if you have already forget about them, that’s fine. The goal was to explore some modern features and a few CSS tricks such as <code>offset</code>, <code>mask</code>, <code>sibling-*</code> functions, container query units, <code>min()</code>/<code>max()</code>, and more!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the first ever <strong>What’s !important</strong>, a roundup of the best CSS and web development news from the last two weeks. If you’re pressed for time (who isn’t?) or you just can’t stand missing out on anything CSS-related, this is the place to recap:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the best CSS/web dev articles from around the web,</li>



<li>interesting announcements and quick-read links that we shared,</li>



<li>the best of what Chrome, Firefox, and Safari have recently shipped,</li>



<li>and more, probably.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s dig in!</p>



<span id="more-391134"></span>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htmhell-advent-calendar-2025">HTMHell Advent Calendar 2025</h3>


<p>Manuel Matuzović has created this pretty hellish (all in good fun) <a href="https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/" rel="noopener">HTMHell Advent Calendar 2025</a> made up of 24 HTML-focused articles — basically, there’s one every day until Christmas Day. Obviously, we’re already 16 fantastic articles in, so you’re in for a real treat with 8 more articles to come. The highlight for me so far is the <a href="https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/7/" rel="noopener">article on Invoker Commands</a>, which as of this week are supported in all web browsers, so it’s a double win!</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="webkit-flagsnbsptargettext">WebKit flags <code>::target-text</code></h3>


<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17628/target-text-an-easy-way-to-style-text-fragments/" rel="noopener">WebKit did a little write-up on <code>::target-text</code>.</a> And I’m glad they did because I had never heard of it, even though <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/pseudo-selectors/t/target-text/">Sunkanmi has an excellent write-up on it here at CSS-Tricks as well</a>. Target text is the text that search engines sometimes highlight when taking you to a web page, but we can actually highlight text ourselves when sending links to other people. <code>::target-text</code> selects this text so that we can style it, and it’s supported by all web browsers — who knew?</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stop-using-javascript-to-solve-css-problems">Stop using JavaScript to solve CSS problems</h3>


<p>Chizaram Ken walks us through the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/stop-using-js-for-css/" rel="noopener">latest CSS tricks that we can perform to reduce our reliance on JavaScript</a>, and why we’d want to do that. With CSS growing faster than it’s ever grown before, I think we’ll be seeing a lot more of these articles.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-have-granular-control-over-hyphenation">We have granular control over hyphenation</h3>


<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eva.town/post/3m7g5j7p72s2w" rel="noopener">@eva.town over at Bluesky said</a> that it’d be nice to be able to set hyphenation rules preventing words like “lighter” from hyphenating as “light-er” — but @knowler.dev pointed out that we can, sort of. The <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hyphenate-limit-chars/">hyphenate-limit-chars</a></code> property (still waiting for Safari support) enables us to specify the preferred minimum number of characters on either side of the hyphen, which is good enough, I suppose?</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="which-color-format-should-we-be-using">Which color format should we be using?</h3>


<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nadyavoynich.com/post/3m7ppr7dcls2s" rel="noopener">@nadyavoynich.com asked this question</a>, but honestly I still don’t know.</p>



<p>Some very good points were made about human-readable formats and color depth, and I’ve kind of settled on <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/">oklch()</a></code>. But some UI design tools don’t even support HSL, so?</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-wrapped-2025-and-state-of-html-2025">CSS Wrapped 2025 and State of HTML 2025</h3>


<p>It’s that time of the year. We’ve had Spotify’s Wrapped, PlayStation’s Wrap-Up, Duolingo’s Year-in-Review — now it’s time for&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/" rel="noopener">CSS Wrapped 2025</a>, all of the latest and greatest things that Chrome did with CSS (and HTML) this year, and&nbsp;<a href="https://2025.stateofhtml.com/" rel="noopener">State of HTML 2025</a>, which is about HTML in general.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cool-conversations-fun-demos-and-new-browser-features">Cool conversations, fun demos, and new browser features</h3>


<p>In case you missed any of our&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/category/quick-hits/">Quick Hits</a>, here are the latest CSS/web dev announcements and links that we’ve shared:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heyo53.bsky.social/post/3m6sxhftrv22i" rel="noopener">This Bluesky post</a>&nbsp;by @heyo53 got us thinking about whether it’s okay to style scrollbars (since people rarely interact with them physically these days, I personally just use&nbsp;<code>scrollbar-width: none</code>)</li>



<li>Bramus put together a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bram.us/2025/12/02/anchor-positioning-and-the-inset-modified-containing-block-imcb/" rel="noopener">demo visualizing the different values for&nbsp;<code>position-area</code></a>&nbsp;and explained how to handle inside corners</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, our top picks for the best CSS and HTML features shipped by web browsers in the last couple of weeks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/143" rel="noopener">Chrome 143</a>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/143#css_anchored_fallback_container_queries" rel="noopener">Anchored container queries</a>, which I briefly talked about in an&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-else-could-container-queries-query/#aa-anchored-container-queries">article on container queries</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/146" rel="noopener">Firefox 146</a>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-css-contrast-color-function-a-second-time/"><code>contrast-color()</code></a>, which ensures optimal color contrast between two colors (or at least it will once it leverages&nbsp;<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-6/#contrast-color-winner" rel="noopener">CSS Color 6</a>)</li>



<li><code>text-decoration-inset</code>, which enables control over the position and size of text decorations</li>



<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/scope/">@scope</a></code>, which makes defining new CSS scoping contexts a baseline feature (this, frankly, is the highlight of my&nbsp;<strong>year</strong>)</li>



<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/can-we-have-custom-media-queries-please/">@custom-media</a></code>, which is basically custom properties but for media queries, is being trialed</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-26_2-release-notes" rel="noopener">Safari 26.2</a>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/r/random/">random()</a></code> generates a random number in CSS, but unfortunately it’s not supported anywhere else yet.</li>



<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/">sibling-index()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/">sibling-count()</a></code> get the position and number of siblings respectively (we’re only waiting for Firefox support now).</li>



<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/field-sizing/">field-sizing</a></code> enables adaptive sizing for input fields (again, hurry up Firefox).</li>



<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/invoker-commands-additional-ways-to-work-with-dialog-popover-and-more/"><code>command</code> and <code>commandfor</code></a>, now baseline and my pick for best HTML feature of the year, are HTML attributes for invoking certain JavaScript events declaratively.</li>



<li><code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/covering-hiddenuntil-found/">hidden=until-found</a></code>, also baseline now, for hiding elements until found by find-in-page.</li>



<li>Also, we’ve never been able to set&nbsp;<code>cursor</code>&nbsp;on pseudo-elements such as&nbsp;<code>::before</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>::after</code>, but thankfully we can now!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember, you can catch us again in two weeks — happy holidays!</p>

<p>Andy Clarke with a brand-new resource. It generates the sort of fun typography that Andy commonly uses in his own work that&#8217;s geared towards cartoon headings.</p>



<span id="more-391095"></span>



<p>There are a number of configurable options for font, color, stroke, letter spacing, and shadows.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2394" height="1228" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=2394%2C1228&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-391096" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?w=2394&amp;ssl=1 2394w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=1024%2C525&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=768%2C394&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=1536%2C788&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10.37.00-AM.png?resize=2048%2C1051&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>And it spits out the CSS for you to copy-paste.</p>



<p>What if you want to individually style each letter? Well, there&#8217;s no such thing as <code>:nth-letter</code> in CSS at the moment. There are, however, tools that will wrap each character in a separate <code>&lt;span></code>, the most tradition one being <a href="https://github.com/s0wcy/split-text-js/" rel="noopener">SplitText.js</a>. But Andy decided to make a tool for that — called <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/splinter-js-i-made-a-more-accessible-text-splitting-tool" rel="noopener">Splinter.js</a> — as well because he saw opportunities to enhance the accessibility of the generated markup to help prevent some assistive tech from choking on the spans. (<a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/" rel="noopener">GSAP&#8217;s version</a> also does a good job of this.)</p>



<p>Som instead of:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;h2>
  &lt;span>H&lt;/span>
  &lt;span>u&lt;/span>
  &lt;span>m&lt;/span>
  &lt;!-- etc. -->
&lt;/h2></code></pre>



<p>&#8230;we get ARIA-spiced markup:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;h2 data-split="toon" aria-label="Hum Sweet Hum">
  &lt;span class="toon-char" aria-hidden="true">H&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="toon-char" aria-hidden="true">u&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="toon-char" aria-hidden="true">m&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2></code></pre>



<p>And it supports line breaks!</p>

<p>A list of rounded images that slightly overlap each other is a classic web design pattern.</p>



<span id="more-390560"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1009" height="324" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x9Wvyg6Oz6-1009.png?resize=1009%2C324" alt="Two rows of circular avatar images.

<p>You are for sure wondering what the novelty we are bringing here is, right? It has been done countless times.</p>



<p>You are right. The main idea is not complex, but the new thing is the responsive part. We will see how to dynamically adjust the overlap between the images so they can fit inside their container. And we will make some cool animations for it along the way!</p>



<p>Here is a demo of what we are creating. You can resize the window and hover the images to see how they behave. And yes, the gap between the images is transparent!</p>



<p class="is-style-explanation">The following demo is currently limited to Chrome and Edge, but will work in other browsers as the <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/">sibling-index()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/">sibling-count()</a></code> functions gain broader support. You can track Firefox support in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1953973" rel="noopener">Ticket #1953973</a> and WebKit’s position in <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/471" rel="noopener">Issue #471</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll get even deeper into things in a second article. For now, let’s re-create this demo!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="responsive-list-of-avatars-using-modern-css">Responsive List of Avatars Using Modern CSS</h4>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-initial-setup">The initial setup</h3>


<p>We start with the HTML, which is a set of image elements in a parent container:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="container">
  &lt;img src="" alt="">
  &lt;img src="" alt="">
  &lt;img src="" alt="">
  &lt;img src="" alt="">
  &lt;!-- etc. -->
&lt;/div></code></pre>



<p>Declaring flexbox on the container is all we need to line the images up in a single row:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: flex;
}</code></pre>



<p>We can make the images circles with <code>border-radius</code> and squish them close together with a little negative <code>margin</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-right: -20px;
}
.container img:last-child {
  margin: 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Nothing fancy so far. I am using an arbitrary value for the margin to create an overlap:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_vEGZKby/e0a82342e98283839d758f146b487508" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/vEGZKby/e0a82342e98283839d758f146b487508?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vEGZKby/e0a82342e98283839d758f146b487508&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed vEGZKby/e0a82342e98283839d758f146b487508" title="CodePen Embed vEGZKby/e0a82342e98283839d758f146b487508" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cut-out-effect">The cut-out effect</h3>


<p>We’ll need the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mask/"><code>mask</code></a> property to cut the images and create the transparent gap between them. Making the gap transparent is very important here as it makes the component look better — but it’s also more challenging to code since the cut-out needs to consider the next (or previous) element in a way that prevents one image from obscuring the other.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(150% - 20px), #0000 100%, #000);</code></pre>



<p>This <code>mask</code> creates a circular shape with the same dimensions as one of the images — a radius equal to <code>50%</code> in both directions — and its center point will be the midpoint of the next element (<code>calc(150% - 20px)</code>). Without the overlap, the center of the next element is at <code>50% (center of the actual element) + 100%</code>. But due to the overlap, the next image is closer, so we reduce the distance by <code>20px</code>, which is the value used by the margin. This cut the image from the right side.</p>



<p>If we want the cut-out on the left side, we move the circle in the other direction: <code>50% - 100% + 20px</code>.</p>



<p>Drag the slider in the next demo for a visualization of how this works in both directions. I am removing the <code>border-radius</code> from the center image to illustrate the circular shape.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_myPwrxx/90e1c2115dca41baa9bb18b7c2725a80" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/myPwrxx/90e1c2115dca41baa9bb18b7c2725a80?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=myPwrxx/90e1c2115dca41baa9bb18b7c2725a80&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed myPwrxx/90e1c2115dca41baa9bb18b7c2725a80" title="CodePen Embed myPwrxx/90e1c2115dca41baa9bb18b7c2725a80" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>We apply this to all the images, and we are good to go. Notice that I am using a couple of CSS variables to control the image size and gap between the images.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  --s: 120px; /* image size*/
  --g: 10px;  /* the gap */

  display: flex;
}
.container img {
  width: var(--s);
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-right: -20px;
  /* Cut-out on the right side */
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(150% - 20px),
        #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)),#000);
}
/* Cut-out on the left side */
.container.reverse img {
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(-50% + 20px),
        #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)),#000);
}
.container img:last-child {
  margin: 0;
}
.container.reverse img:first-child,
.container:not(.reverse) img:last-child {
  mask: none;
}</code></pre>



<p>Pay additional attention to the <code>.reverse</code> class. It switches the direction of the cut-out from right (the default) to left instead.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_myPwrjL/7e36b0767aa6c02b24629233a1ea14ea" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/myPwrjL/7e36b0767aa6c02b24629233a1ea14ea?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=myPwrjL/7e36b0767aa6c02b24629233a1ea14ea&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed myPwrjL/7e36b0767aa6c02b24629233a1ea14ea" title="CodePen Embed myPwrjL/7e36b0767aa6c02b24629233a1ea14ea" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>What we have is already good. It works fine and you can use it, but it could be more interactive. The overlap look nice but wouldn’t be better if we could enlarge it on smaller screens to help conserve space, or perhaps even remove it altogether on larger screens where there’s plenty of room to show the full images?</p>



<p>Let’s make this more interactive and responsive.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-responsive-part">The responsive part</h3>


<p>Let’s imagine the total size of the images exceeds the size of the <code>.container</code>. That results in an overflow, so we need to assign a negative margin to each image to absorb that space and ensure all the images fit in the container.</p>



<p>It looks like we need some JavaScript to calculate the excess of space and then divide it by the number of images to get the margin value. And probably put this logic inside a resize listener in case the container change its size.</p>



<p>I am kidding, of course! We can solve this using modern CSS that is small and maintainable.</p>



<p>If we were to express what we need mathematically, the formula of the margin should be equal to:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">margin-right: (size_of_container - N x size_of_image)/(N - 1);</code></pre>



<p>…where <code>N</code> is the number of images, and we are dividing by <code>N - 1</code> because the last image doesn’t need a margin. We already have a variable for the image size (<code>--s</code>) and we know that the width of the container is <code>100%</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">margin-right: (100% - N x var(--s))/(N - 1);</code></pre>



<p>What need to solve for is <code>N</code>, the number of images. We could use a rigid magic number here, say 10, but what if we want fewer or more images in the container? We’d have to update the CSS each time. We want a solution that adapts to whatever number of images we throw at it.</p>



<p>That’s where the new <code>sibling-count()</code> function comes in real handy. It’s going to be the best approach moving forward since it automatically calculates the number of child elements within the container. So, if there are 10 images in the <code>.container</code>, the <code>sibling-count()</code> is 10.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">margin-right: calc((100% - sibling-count() * var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 1));</code></pre>



<p>Resize the container in the demo below and see how the images behave. Again, <code>sibling-count()</code> support is limited at the moment, but you can check it out in the latest Chrome or Safari Technology Preview.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_RNagoOX/8b8892383fdf7b998e8d47314415152a" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/RNagoOX/8b8892383fdf7b998e8d47314415152a?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=RNagoOX/8b8892383fdf7b998e8d47314415152a&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed RNagoOX/8b8892383fdf7b998e8d47314415152a" title="CodePen Embed RNagoOX/8b8892383fdf7b998e8d47314415152a" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="542" style="aspect-ratio: 1512 / 542;" width="1512" controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stacked-images-responsive-margin.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>It’s quite good! The images automatically adjust to fit in the container, but we can still improve this slightly. When the container size is large enough, the calculated value of margin will be positive and we get big spaces between the images. You probably want to keep that behavior, but in my case, I want the image to remain as close as possible.</p>



<p>To do this, we can set a maximum boundary to the <code>margin</code> value and make sure it doesn’t get any bigger than <code>0</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">margin-right: min((100% - sibling-count() * var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 1), 0px);</code></pre>



<p>We can also re-use the the gap variable (<code>--g</code>) to maintain a space between items:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">margin-right: min((100% - sibling-count() * var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 1), var(--g));</code></pre>



<p>If you’re wondering why I am using the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/"><code>min()</code></a> function to define a max boundary, <a href="https://css-tip.com/min-max/" rel="noopener">read this</a> for a detailed explanation. In short: you’re effectively setting a maximum with <code>min()</code> and a minimum with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/max/"><code>max()</code></a>.</p>



<p>The responsive part is perfect now!!</p>

<p>Oops, the images disappeared! We have the same code as the previous section, but instead of the arbitrary <code>20px</code> value, we used the last formula.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img {
  --_m: min((100% - sibling-count() * var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 1), var(--g));

  margin-right: var(--_m);
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(150% + var(--_m)),
        #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)),#000);
}</code></pre>



<p>Can you guess what the issue is? Think a moment about it because it’s something you may face in other situations.</p>



<p><strong>It’s related to percentages.</strong> With <code>margin</code>, the percentage refers to the container size, but inside mask, it considers another reference, which means the values aren’t equal. We need to retrieve the container size differently, using container query units instead.</p>



<p>First, we register the <code>.container</code> as a CSS &#8220;container&#8221;:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}</code></pre>



<p>Then, we can say that the container’s width is <code>100cqi</code> (or <code>100cqw</code>) instead of <code>100%</code>, which fixes the layout issue:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_EaKXZbM/c63a620e76fb048eb24c60f871caa461" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/EaKXZbM/c63a620e76fb048eb24c60f871caa461?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=EaKXZbM/c63a620e76fb048eb24c60f871caa461&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed EaKXZbM/c63a620e76fb048eb24c60f871caa461" title="CodePen Embed EaKXZbM/c63a620e76fb048eb24c60f871caa461" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p><em>Tada!</em> The position and the mask adjust perfectly when the container is resized.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-animation-part">The animation part</h3>


<p>The idea of the animation is to fully reveal an image on hover if there is an overlap between items, like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="642" style="aspect-ratio: 1682 / 642;" width="1682" controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stacked-images-responsive-margin-animation.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>How do we remove the overlap? All we do is update the variable (<code>--_m</code>) we defined earlier to zero when an image is hovered:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img:hover {
  --_m: 0px;
}</code></pre>



<p>That takes out the <code>margin</code> and removes the cut-out effect as well. We actually might want a <em>little</em> bit of margin between images, so let’s make <code>--_m</code> equal to the gap (<code>--g</code>) instead:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container img:hover {
  --_m: var(--g);
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ByKZpvw/41571b0dc79f93fa3733ae3c0e705e5b" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByKZpvw/41571b0dc79f93fa3733ae3c0e705e5b?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ByKZpvw/41571b0dc79f93fa3733ae3c0e705e5b&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ByKZpvw/41571b0dc79f93fa3733ae3c0e705e5b" title="CodePen Embed ByKZpvw/41571b0dc79f93fa3733ae3c0e705e5b" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Not bad! But we can do better. Notice how pushing one image away from another causes an image at the end to overflow the container. The bottom list (the row with the cut-out on the left) is not as good as the top list because the mask is a bit off on hover.</p>



<p>Let’s first fix the mask before tackling the overflow.</p>



<p>The issue is that I am using <code>margin-right</code> for the spacing while the cut-out effect is on the left. It works fine when we don’t need any animation but as you can see, it’s not quite good in the last demo. We need switch to a <code>margin-left</code> instead on the bottom row. In other words, we use <code>margin-right</code> when the cut-out is on the right, and <code>margin-left</code> when the cut-out is on the left.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="4,9,14"><code markup="tt">.container:not(.reverse) img {
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(150% + var(--_m)),
        #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)), #000);
  margin-right: var(--_m);
}
.container.reverse img {
  mask: radial-gradient(50% 50% at calc(-50% - var(--_m)),
        #0000 calc(100% + var(--g)), #000);
  margin-left: var(--_m);
}
.container:not(.reverse) img:last-child,
.container.reverse img:first-child {
  mask: none;
  margin: 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Great, now the cut-out effect is much better and respects both the left and right sides:</p>

<p>Let’s fix the overflow now. Remember the previous formula where we split the excess of space across <code>N - 1</code> elements?</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">(size_of_container - N x size_of_image)/(N - 1)</code></pre>



<p>Now we need to exclude one more element in the equation, which means we replace the <code>N</code> with <code>N - 1</code> and replace the <code>N - 1</code> with <code>N - 2</code>:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">(size_of_container - (N - 1) x size_of_image)/(N - 2)</code></pre>



<p>However, that extra excluded element still takes up space inside the container. We need to account for its size and subtract it from the container size:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">((size_of_container - (size_of_image + gap)) - (N - 1) x size_of_image)/(N - 2)</code></pre>



<p>I am considering the size plus a gap because a <code>margin</code> that is equal to the gap is set on a hovered image, which is additional spacing we need to remove.</p>



<p>We simplify a bit:</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">(size_of_container - gap -  N x size_of_image)/(N - 2)</code></pre>



<p>We know how to translate this into CSS, but where should we apply it?</p>



<p>It should be applied on all the images when one image is hovered (except the hovered image). This is a great opportunity to write a fancy selector using <code>:has()</code> and <code>:not()</code>!</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* Select images that are not hovered when the container contains a hovered image */
.container:has(:hover) img:not(:hover) {
  /**/
}</code></pre>



<p>And we plug the formula into that:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container:has(:hover) img:not(:hover) {
  --_m: min((100cqw - var(--g) - sibling-count()*var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 2), var(--g));
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ZYWyezZ/6404dc5977e3d387c784acd9dceee3b2" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ZYWyezZ/6404dc5977e3d387c784acd9dceee3b2?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ZYWyezZ/6404dc5977e3d387c784acd9dceee3b2&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ZYWyezZ/6404dc5977e3d387c784acd9dceee3b2" title="CodePen Embed ZYWyezZ/6404dc5977e3d387c784acd9dceee3b2" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Check that out — no more overflow on hover in both directions! All we are missing now is the actual animation that smoothly transitions the spacing rather than snapping things into place. All we need is to add a little <code>transition</code> on the <code>--_m</code> variable:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">transition: --_m .3s linear;</code></pre>



<p>If we do that, however, the <code>transition</code> doesn’t happen. It’s because CSS doesn’t recognize the calculated value as a proper <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-length-units/">CSS length unit</a>. For that, we need to formally register <code>--_m</code> as a custom property using the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/p/property/"><code>@property</code></a> at-rule:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@property --_m {
  syntax: "&lt;length>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: 0px
}</code></pre>



<p>There we go:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_xbVrqxG/3e861c45ab6cdd1d141831c823041b8e" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/xbVrqxG/3e861c45ab6cdd1d141831c823041b8e?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=xbVrqxG/3e861c45ab6cdd1d141831c823041b8e&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed xbVrqxG/3e861c45ab6cdd1d141831c823041b8e" title="CodePen Embed xbVrqxG/3e861c45ab6cdd1d141831c823041b8e" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="642" style="aspect-ratio: 1716 / 642;" width="1716" controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stacked-images-responsive-01.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>Cool, right? Having a smooth change for the mask and the position is quite satisfying. We still need to fix a small edge case. The last element in the top list and the first one in the bottom list don’t have any margin, and they are always fully visible, so we need to exclude them from the effect.</p>



<p>When hovering them, nothing should happen, so we can adjust the previous selector like below:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container:not(.reverse):has(:not(:last-child):hover) img:not(:hover),
.container.reverse:has(:not(:first-child):hover) img:not(:hover) {
  --_m: min((100cqw - var(--g) - sibling-count()*var(--s))/(sibling-count() - 2),var(--g));
}</code></pre>



<p>Instead of simply checking if the container has a hovered element, we restrict the selection to the elements that are not <code>:last-child</code> for the first list and not <code>:first-child</code> for the second list. Another cool selector using modern CSS!</p>



<p>Here is the final demo with all the adjustments made:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_VYavBwN" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/VYavBwN?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=VYavBwN&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed VYavBwN" title="CodePen Embed VYavBwN" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ll admit, when container queries first shipped back in 2022, I didn’t really pay attention. I mean, why <a href="https://css-tricks.com/smart-layouts-with-container-queries/">container size queries</a> when we already have <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/">media queries</a>? Why <a href="https://css-tricks.com/digging-deeper-into-container-style-queries/">container style queries</a> when custom properties inherit anyway (they don’t work with standard properties… <em>yet</em>)? Their use cases seemed like edge cases to me, enabling us to do things that we could already do but in a different way.</p>



<span id="more-390654"></span>



<p>Here&#8217;s a container size queries demo by <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/kevinpowell/">Kevin Powell</a>. As a note, all major browsers support size queries in the following demo, but other demos in this article may require the latest Chrome.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_NWZgQwE" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/NWZgQwE?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=NWZgQwE&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed NWZgQwE" title="CodePen Embed NWZgQwE" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Container style queries (with the new <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-range-syntax-has-come-to-container-style-queries-and-if/">range syntax</a>) demo by, <em>uh</em>, me:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_raxpXLO" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/raxpXLO?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=raxpXLO&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed raxpXLO" title="CodePen Embed raxpXLO" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>And more recently, we’ve seen a couple more types of container queries pop up.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="container-scroll-state-queries">Container Scroll-State Queries</h3>


<p>Container scroll-state queries came along with their unique capabilities — the ability to find out whether a container is scrollable, or is scroll-snapped to a scroll target, or has <code>position: sticky</code> and is ‘stuck.’ Literally, as I’m writing this, Chrome announced <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-144-beta?hl=en#scroll-state_scrolled_support" rel="noopener"><code>scrolled</code> support</a>, which is a bit different to <code>scrollable</code>.</p>



<p>Container scroll-state queries demo by our very own <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/">Geoff Graham</a>:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_OPLwNma" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/OPLwNma?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=OPLwNma&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed OPLwNma" title="CodePen Embed OPLwNma" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>And that’s not all we’ve got…</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="anchored-container-queries">Anchored container queries</h3>


<p>The latest container query feature is <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchored-container-queries" rel="noopener">anchored container queries</a>, which enable us to query fallback positions. Imagine that you anchor-position a tooltip caret to the left side of a tooltip, but then there’s no room to display the tooltip, so you flip it to the opposite side of whatever triggers it using <code>position-try-fallbacks: flip-inline</code>. Well, an anchored container query can detect when the tooltip position is flipped so that we can also flip the tooltip caret to the opposite side of the tooltip.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_gbrMGYx" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/gbrMGYx?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gbrMGYx&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed gbrMGYx" title="CodePen Embed gbrMGYx" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-else-">What else?</h3>


<p>So, it got me thinking, <em>how far can we really go with container queries?</em> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/">There are dozens of media queries now</a>, so what if there were dozens of container queries as well? What could we use them for?</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="get-any-computed-value">Get any computed value</h4>


<p>Recently I was exploring <a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-inheriting-and-sharing-property-values/">the current and future methods of getting the value of a CSS property and using it with another property</a>, and as you can imagine, container size queries were mentioned since they unlock <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-length-units/#relative-units">container query units</a>. I mean, have you ever added a wrapper element or defined an existing one as a container just to access container query units?</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;parent> {
  /* Gimme container query units! */
  container-type: inline-size;

  &lt;child> {
    width: 100cqi;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>Now, I don’t love container queries as a means of getting values because the syntax can be a bit long-winded for that (longer than the example above, and size queries in particular are a bit quirky), but the fact that we can use them to do a little more than querying is testament to how versatile they are as a feature. As an alternative, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-inheriting-and-sharing-property-values/">I suggested a CSS function</a> called <code>compute()</code>, where if you wanted the <code>height</code> of something (or the “something” of anything), we could steal it from another element like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;parent> {
  &lt;child> {
    /* Computed height of &lt;child> */
    property: compute(height, self);
    /* Computed height of the parent */
    property: compute(height, inherit);
    /* Computed height of #abc element */
    property: compute(height, #abc);
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This would save us from having to implement a container size query just to use its container query units, and would also apply to all properties. Besides, a container size query wouldn’t help us to acquire the un-computed declared value that we actually typed out. For that, the <code>inherit()</code> function has been proposed and <a href="https://blog.kizu.dev/play-with-inherit-function/" rel="noopener">Roma even shows us how to use it</a> in Chrome Canary.</p>



<p>To add, I really like the keyword approach and would love to see more keywords like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/currentcolor/"><code>currentColor</code></a> (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5292" rel="noopener"><code>currentBackgroundColor</code> has been proposed</a>).</p>



<p>Still, if container queries could be extended to get the value of <em>any</em> CSS property, I definitely wouldn’t say no to that! The flexibility to pass properties/values between elements is way too enticing.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="query-any-css-property">Query any CSS property</h4>


<p>This feature has actually been on the slate since container style queries were first proposed, but there’s no telling when it will arrive. This container style query upgrade will enable us to query the (un-computed/declared) value of any CSS property instead of just custom properties (although you won’t be able to ‘get’ and use those values, at least as far as I know).</p>



<p><em>Any</em> CSS property? Uh, doesn’t that make all of the other container queries redundant? Not quite, no.</p>



<p>Container scroll-state queries detect snapping and stickiness, for which there are no pseudo-classes — but maybe there should be? They also detect scrollability, since, for example, <code>overflow: scroll</code> and <code>overflow: visible</code> doesn’t mean that the content is actually overflowing, only that we’re allowed to scroll the container if it does. Finally, anchored container queries don’t query the <code>position-try-fallbacks</code> value, they detect <em>when</em>, for example, the <code>position-area</code> is flipped.</p>



<p>So, you know, they do a whole bunch of stuff, and that’s why this upgrade for container style queries won’t replace them. In fact, I can totally see dozens of new container query features hitting the web within the next few years.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-what-else-could-container-queries-do-">So, what else could container queries do?</h4>


<p>Before container queries were even a thing, great ideas were being put forward. Of course, some of them actually became container queries whereas others are still just that — great ideas that haven’t gone anywhere (again&#8230;<em>yet?</em>).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5989#issuecomment-783702864" rel="noopener">Adam Argyle suggested</a> some interesting things that would later become scroll-state queries, in addition to being able to query whether something’s on-screen, wrapping, or ellipsing, which I’d love to see.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5989#issuecomment-858739994" rel="noopener">Adam also suggested being able to count child nodes</a>, an idea that later became <code>sibling-count()</code> and <code>sibling-index()</code>, although I&#8217;d still like to see the container query approach.</li>



<li>In a similar vein, Matthew Dean pointed out that <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6402#issuecomment-1094141090" rel="noopener">some container queries could instead or also be pseudo-classes</a>, which I agree with. Matthew also suggested that <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6402#issuecomment-1094140594" rel="noopener">container queries could be used to query whether a flex container is wrapped</a>, and which row/column of a flexbox/grid container we’re in.</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m confident that we’ll see these ideas realized at some point, either as container queries or as some other syntax. Heck, since it&#8217;s December, I&#8217;ll make it my prediction for 2026: container queries will rule 2026.</p>



<p>What else do <em>you</em> want container queries to do?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The CSS <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation-timeline/"><code>animation-timeline</code></a> property accepts a <code>view()</code> function which, in turn, returns a timeline of how much of an element is visible in the part of a scroll container that’s viewable (formally known as a <em>scrollport</em>). In other words, rather than letting an animation run a linear progression based on how much time has elapsed, <code>view()</code> runs animations based on the visibility of the animated element within a scrollport.</p>



<p>I like to equate it as the CSS version of JavaScript’s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/an-explanation-of-how-the-intersection-observer-watches/">Intersection Observer</a>. We can run an animation on an element as that element enters and exits the scrollport.</p>



<span id="more-390516"></span>



<p>Here’s an example:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_emZmBwQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/emZmBwQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=emZmBwQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed emZmBwQ" title="CodePen Embed emZmBwQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="886" style="aspect-ratio: 1400 / 886;" width="1400" controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animation-carousel.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>Pretty neat, right? Depending on <em>where</em> an image is in the scrollable carousel, it goes from small and blurry at the far sides while getting larger and clearer when it hits the center. We have a little <a href="https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/">scroll snapping</a> in there as well to make sure each image item makes a stop.</p>



<p>It’s not that hard to do! I’ll show you how it&#8217;s really the same old animation you’re used to writing in CSS, only applied on a view timeline instead of a normal timeline.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="but-first-the-general-layout">But first, the general layout</h3>


<p>All I’m making here is an element I’m calling <code>.carousel</code>:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;main class="carousel">
  &lt;!-- scroll items -->
&lt;/main></code></pre>



<p>The elements in <code>.carousel</code> will lay out in a single row, which is a one-liner with flexbox. We’ll also make sure that any content overflowing its space is scrollable:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel {
  display: flex;
  width: max(480px, 50vw);
  overflow-x: auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>And, of course, we need items in it that we can scroll around. A set of image slides.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;main class="carousel">
  &lt;div class="carousel-slide">
    &lt;!-- (optional) empty bookend slide -->
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;div class="carousel-slide">
      &lt;img src="image-1.jpeg" alt="alt text for image 1">
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;div class="carousel-slide">
      &lt;img src="image-2.jpeg" alt="alt text for image 2">
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;!-- etc -->
  &lt;div class="carousel-slide">
    &lt;!-- (optional) empty bookend slide -->
  &lt;/div>
&lt;/main></code></pre>



<p>As far as styling those items, each one will be one-third the size of the available space so that we see three items at a time when scrolling:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel {
  /* same as before */

  .carousel-slide {
    flex-shrink: 0;
    width: calc(100% / 3); /* show three at a time */
    aspect-ratio: .8;
    img {
      width: 100%;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="then-the-scrolling">Then the scrolling</h3>


<p>We’ve already set <code>overflow-x</code> on the <code>.carousel</code>, officially making it our scroll container. We can drop in a little scroll snapping to make sure we’re only scrolling one item at a time.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel {
  /* same as before */

  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-behavior: smooth; /* optional for smooth scrolling */
  scrollbar-width: none; /* optional to hide the scrollbar */
}</code></pre>



<p>We want to make sure that the slides are aligned to the center of the scroll container when snapping into place:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel-slide {
  /* etc. */
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}</code></pre>



<p>Here’s what we have so far:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_yyOXZPa" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/yyOXZPa?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yyOXZPa&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed yyOXZPa" title="CodePen Embed yyOXZPa" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="next-the-animation">Next, the animation</h3>


<p>Here’s the really cool thing I mentioned at the very start: a view timeline animation is really the same thing as any other CSS animation you write with keyframes. In this case, we want keyframes where the carousel items are small and blurry at the start and end, but become larger and clearer right smack dab in the middle of the animation.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@keyframes slide {
  /* from start to 45%, and to the end (100%) */
  45%, 100% {
    transform: scale(0.5);
    border-radius: 20px;
    filter: blur(6px) brightness(.8);
  }
  /* middle */
  50% {
    transform: scale(1);
    border-radius: 4px;
    filter: none;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>Looks familiar, right? This is the sort of CSS you’ve been writing forever! And guess what? We set the animation on the element we’re animating just as you normally would as well:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel-slide {
  /* etc. */
  animation: slide; 
}</code></pre>



<p>The only difference is that we want the animation to run on a timeline based on the element’s current <code>view()</code> instead of the regular timeline. That’s where the <code>animation-timeline</code> property comes into play:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.carousel-slide {
  /* etc. */
  animation: slide; 
  animation-timeline: view(inline);
}</code></pre>



<p>Now, <em>technically</em> speaking, we could slap that timeline directly in the <code>animation</code> shorthand property like any other constituent animation property, e.g., <code>animation-name</code>, <code>animation-delay</code>, <code>animation-duration</code>, etc. But assigning a timeline function this way is not supported by any browsers yet. So, for now, your best bet is to declare it on its own. Just be sure to declare it <em>after</em> the <code>animation</code> shorthand, or else you may find yourself inadvertently overriding your view timeline with <code>auto</code> (the default property value) instead of <code>view()</code>.</p>



<p>That completes our demo:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_emZmBwQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/emZmBwQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=emZmBwQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed emZmBwQ" title="CodePen Embed emZmBwQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="886" style="aspect-ratio: 1400 / 886;" width="1400" controls src="http://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animation-carousel.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>See that? All we’ve really done is set a CSS animation that runs on elements. However, instead of running on the default timeline, the animation runs when an element scrolls in and out of view. That’s the difference between standard and view timelines.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="-view-vs-scroll-"><code>view()</code> vs. <code>scroll()</code></h3>


<p><em>But wait!</em> You may or may not know that <code>view()</code> timelines are part of a larger feature set called <a href="https://css-tricks.com/unleash-the-power-of-scroll-driven-animations/">CSS Scroll-Driven Animations</a>. And <code>view()</code> is not the only function supported by the <code>animation-timeline</code> property. We also have the <code>scroll()</code> function.</p>



<p>The <code>scroll()</code> function creates a <em>scroll progress timeline</em> that’s tied to the scroll position of a container, whereas <code>view()</code> creates a <em>view progress timeline</em> that’s based on the visibility of an element within its container.</p>



<p>Both functions are useful in their own ways! I generally think <code>view()</code> is better for item-specific reveal effects. So, for example, if we want to animate a slide <em>only as that specific slide scrolls into the scrollport</em>, then the <code>view()</code> function is the perfect fit. That’s why I’ve focused on it for our carousel example — we want to track an element’s position in the scrollport and run the animation accordingly.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="inset-parameter-and-animation-range-">Inset parameter and <code>animation-range</code></h3>


<p>You might also be wondering what the heck goes in the parentheses of the <code>view()</code> function. It’s a function, after all, so it must accept something in there, right?</p>



<p>CSS <code>view()</code> takes two arguments: <strong>axis</strong> (<code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>) and the <strong>inset</strong>. The inset parameter defines an offset from the scrollport&#8217;s edges within which the animated element is tracked. The official syntax looks like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">animation-timeline: view(&lt;axis> &lt;view-timeline-inset>);</code></pre>



<p>&#8230;which is merely a fancy way of getting specific with exactly what areas of the scrollport we want to trigger the animation. For some animations, starting and ending the timeline when element fully enters and exits the scrollport may cut things off.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_OPNjXem" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/OPNjXem?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=OPNjXem&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed OPNjXem" title="CodePen Embed OPNjXem" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="459" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set-1024x459.png?resize=1024%2C459&#038;ssl=1" alt="Two columns of list items. The width of the first item is 100% and each subsequent item in the list gets progressively shorter, creating an effect like a reversed staircase." class="wp-image-390524" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set.png?resize=1024%2C459&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set.png?resize=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set.png?resize=768%2C344&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set.png?resize=1536%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-range-not-set.png?w=1982&amp;ssl=1 1982w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>That’s no good! We want each item to fully slide in when it fully enters the scrollport, not when it fully exits. That’s why all the items look so staggered — they’re all at different points in the view timeline.</p>



<p>That’s where the inset parameter makes a big difference. We can be more specific about saying we want each element to start animation when it comes up from the bottom of the scrollport.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">animation: slide-in linear both;
animation-timeline: view(100% 0%);</code></pre>



<p>Ah, much much better:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_MYyvjWP" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/MYyvjWP?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=MYyvjWP&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed MYyvjWP" title="CodePen Embed MYyvjWP" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video height="886" style="aspect-ratio: 1974 / 886;" width="1974" controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/scroll-animations-view-slide-in.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://css-tricks.com/unleash-the-power-of-scroll-driven-animations/#aa-timeline-ranges-demystified"><code>animation-range</code></a> property works along similar lines.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">animation-range: entry; /* same as: entry 0 entry 100%; */</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GgZvjwQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GgZvjwQ?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GgZvjwQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GgZvjwQ" title="CodePen Embed GgZvjwQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The <code>animation-range</code> property accepts a slew of other keywords, including <code>exit</code> (when the element leaves the scrollport), <code>cover</code> (when the element begins to enter begins to leave the scrollport), and <code>contain</code> (when the element fully enters then fully leaves the scrollport), among others. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/unleash-the-power-of-scroll-driven-animations/#aa-timeline-ranges-demystified">Geoff has published a bunch of notes and examples</a> looking specifically at each one.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="one-last-carousel-example">One last carousel example</h3>


<p>Generally, carousels use effects like fade in-and-out, scaling, and parallax. However, since most CSS properties are animate-able, and even those who aren’t can be tricked into being so using registered CSS properties (like in the case of gradient lines), you have the option to explore more creative ways of using <code>view()</code> for carousels.</p>



<p>Here’s an example where an animation of just the background position creates a nice movement in a carousel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_JoXbNbg" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/JoXbNbg?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=JoXbNbg&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed JoXbNbg" title="CodePen Embed JoXbNbg" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<p>We&#8217;ve been tracking many of these features as well:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-the-interest-invoker-api-for-hover-triggered-popovers/">Interest Invoker API</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/invoker-commands-additional-ways-to-work-with-dialog-popover-and-more/">Invoker Commands</a> enable us to work with dialog and popover elements directly in our markup without having to reach for JavaScript.</li>



<li>We are able to tell more interesting stories using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/scrollytelling-on-steroids-with-scroll-state-queries/">scroll state queries</a>.</li>



<li>Juan has been <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-wait-for-the-sibling-count-and-sibling-index-functions/">looking forward</a> to the <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/">sibling-count()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/">sibling-index()</a></code> functions, both of which have been implemented.</li>



<li>The <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/">attr()</a></code> CSS function was enhanced, it actually does what you&#8217;d expect now!</li>



<li>We have a new way to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/">conditionally adjust properties</a> using the <code>if()</code> function.</li>



<li>Designing interesting looking elements is a bit easier now thanks to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-shape-commands/"><code>shape()</code> commands</a>.</li>



<li>Similarly, we have a lot more control over element corners with <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-can-we-actually-do-with-corner-shape/">corner-shape()</a></code>, not just <code>border-radius</code> anymore.</li>



<li>And If all these new functions weren&#8217;t enough, we are able to create our own <a href="https://css-tricks.com/functions-in-css/">custom CSS functions</a>! </li>
</ul>



<p>This is just scratching the surface though, check out the full CSS Wrapped 2025 to see what all made it into the Chrome browser in 2025. It&#8217;s been a wild year for CSS and the CSS Wrapped 2025 page itself demonstrates that in spades.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Chrome team recently prototyped a working solution for fitting text to the width of a container in CSS using a <code>text-grow</code> property.</p>

</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;length&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;(optional): The maximum font size for&nbsp;<code>text-grow</code>&nbsp;or minimum font size for&nbsp;<code>text-shrink</code>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Notice the different fit methods — they either scale the glyphs or adjust the text&#8217;s actual <code>font-size</code>. So, naturally, the explainer <a href="https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#detailed-design-discussion" rel="noopener">notes</a> that accessibility concerns are still being worked out. Like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>If an end-user tries to enlarge font size, UAs should not fit enlarged lines to the container width. Is minimum-font setting enough?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Speaking of open questions, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/una.im/post/3m7azmmmnes2k" rel="noopener">Una Kravets highlights a few on Bluesky</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Should the last line of a paragraph be scaled?</li>



<li>Is the current line-height behavior as expected?</li>



<li>Should it scale non-text parts such as inline images together?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2528" rel="noopener">contribute to the discussion</a> in the GitHub issue, of course.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.damato.design/posts/fit-text-responsibly/" rel="noopener">Donnie D’Amato wonders</a> if, perhaps, this idea is better suited for print styles rather than screens. That&#8217;s an excellent use case I hadn&#8217;t thought of.</p>



<p>We sure have come a long way from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/">the days of magic numbers and FitText.js</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I would like to tell you what I learned from a five-year old child about HTML and CSS.</p>



<p>Just when I opened my code editor and browser and began writing basic <a href="https://css-tricks.com/html-boilerplates/">HTML boilerplate</a>, my niece walked in. She is tiny and normally very loud, but was standing quietly next to my desk on this particular day, as if she was looking for something.</p>



<span id="more-390475"></span>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Niece:</strong> Wassat? Wassat you typing?<br><strong>Me:</strong> Something for the computer.<br><strong>Niece:</strong> It looks funny. All the little lines.<br><strong>Me:</strong> They are instructions.<br><strong>Niece:</strong> Instwu… inschu… instwushun?<br><strong>Me:</strong> Instructions.</pre>



<p>I paused and remembered a <a href="https://www.quora.com/A-6-year-old-wants-to-make-a-website-I-know-basic-HTML-CSS-but-Im-not-good-at-teaching-How-or-where-should-I-start" rel="noopener">Quora question</a> I stumbled on few days earlier about explaining HTML and CSS to a child. I totally skipped the question — I was just scrolling around at the time — but now with my niece standing next to me, I found myself wishing I’d looked it over.</p>



<p>Here’s how I answered. It’s funny how explaining something you do almost naturally teaches you about yourself and what you take for granted.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-re-building-a-house-with-bricks-">We’re building a “house” with “bricks”</h3>


<p>My niece didn&#8217;t seem to care about the actual code I was writing, like the specific HTML tags that littered my code editor. No, she was more concerned with what was happening in the browser.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Niece:</strong> Oh. So, this big box is your house?<br><strong>Me:</strong> Kind of, yes.</pre>



<p>At that time the screen was empty, looking more like a vast expanse than a webpage. I love that she saw a big white space and likened it to a house that I was building. Her observation pushed me to explain the most basic part of what I was doing.</p>



<p>I told her the editor is where I place my building blocks — not totally unlike having a place where she keeps her LEGOS together as building materials. She watched quietly while I added a simple heading, a short line of text and a button that did not have any behavior yet.</p>



<p>Her eyes were glued on the screen as I refreshed my browser, a few texts appeared. She jerked her head backward a bit when the screen refreshed and turned from an empty house to something with rendered elements.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_zxqzzvJ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/zxqzzvJ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=zxqzzvJ&amp;default-tab=html,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed zxqzzvJ" title="CodePen Embed zxqzzvJ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>She was getting it! No, she couldn’t read the code. But she could see the connection between the house and LEGO pieces that gave it structure.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-legos-are-just-bricks-in-the-house">The LEGOS are just bricks in the house</h3>


<p>I explained that HTML is what structures the house, merely stacking bricks on the white screen. It has nothing to do with what those bricks should look like. A heading is a heading, a paragraph is a paragraph, and a button is another kind of brick. The browser follows my instructions for adding the bricks I want to the house.</p>



<p>Trying to explain that to her forced me to slow down. I found myself describing HTML as the vocabulary of the page: it gives names to each piece so the browser can build the document tree behind the scenes. Then the tree becomes the foundation that CSS and JavaScript can later rely on. Without those names, the browser would not know where the different elements should relate to one other. Already, I was finding it tough to describe HTML without getting into the other core languages.</p>



<p>I paused, watching her reaction, and was reminded something. Every polished writing begins as a bare idea and then transforms into an outline — just like a polished interface begins with an outline. Before any colors, space, or layout, all we have is structure.</p>



<p>Explaining this to her made those fundamentals feel important to me again, like when I first realized the importance of having a separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>



<p>My niece began to stare at my screen for an inordinate amount of time, and the silence felt heavy. Even though the structure was there, the page still looked empty to her and she finally asked why the page looked like that.</p>



<p>She expected something more like a house; something with shapes and rooms. What she saw instead was a plain surface with nothing to hold on to. I pointed out the editor and showed the semantic tags I had written. The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> acts as a container, I told her. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> is sort of like the “roof” of the house and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> like the bottom floor.</p>



<p>I explained to her that those elements behave more like rooms and doorways than decoration. They tell the browser what exists and how one part relates to another one. They do not make anything look good, they “frame” document like you frame a house before putting up doors, walls, paint, and carpet.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_jEqwmgm" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/jEqwmgm?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=jEqwmgm&amp;default-tab=html,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed jEqwmgm" title="CodePen Embed jEqwmgm" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="decorating-the-house">Decorating the house</h3>


<p>Once the concept of structure clicked with her, I began adding some very simple CSS rules. I kept it minimal by adding a <code>width</code>, some <code>height</code> and a <code>border</code> to one of the elements. She watched the characters appear in my dark editor with the same focus you would give to a puzzle. Those properties names, curly braces and brackets look nothing like layout instructions to her but rather unfamiliar symbols.</p>



<p>Then came the moment, I had to take a step back again and try to explain CSS to her. I told her what I was typing are also instructions, just like HTML, but instead of instructions for laying bricks, these were instructions for how the bricks should look. For example, I can tell the browser how large a brick should be, where it should sit, and how it should appear.</p>



<p>This is the core of CSS, right? You select a brick and describe to the browser how it looks. Saying it out loud reminded me that <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/css-is-logical/" rel="noopener">CSS is literal and logical</a>.</p>



<p>A width. A height. And a border. That’s all it takes to add a little shape.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_LENWMBQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/LENWMBQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=LENWMBQ&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed LENWMBQ" title="CodePen Embed LENWMBQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I know there is probably a more “academic” way to teach CSS. For example, <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2018/10/04/the-way-we-talk-about-css/" rel="noopener">writing modes are probably an excellent starting point</a> to get into directionality and positioning before a single splash of color is on the page. That’s all fine and whatnot, but all of that is gibberish to a five-year old. I can’t even get into things like <code>aspect-ratio</code> without first getting into the basic <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Those fancy things can wait for now.</p>



<p>What I was looking for was an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/moment-css-started-making-sense/">“A-ha!” moment</a>. I continued the exercise and drew a little house. Then I refreshed the page and the structure finally had a shape.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_azNwwoa" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/azNwwoa?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=azNwwoa&amp;default-tab=html,result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed azNwwoa" title="CodePen Embed azNwwoa" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t much, of course: a little triangle that looked like a roof, a square pretending to be a wall, two tiny squares for windows, and a skinny rectangle that I guess could be a door. It looked like something you draw fast with a dull pencil. Regardless, my niece leaned in right away, almost bumping her forehead on the screen.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Niece:</strong> Why does the house not have color? It looks so plain.<br><strong>Me:</strong> I haven’t added color yet.<br><strong>Niece:</strong> You forgot. You always forgot.<br><strong>Me:</strong> I’ll add it.</pre>



<p>I added a little color to the house. And that’s when things started to click.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ZYQvXdM" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ZYQvXdM?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ZYQvXdM&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ZYQvXdM" title="CodePen Embed ZYQvXdM" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Niece:</strong> So this brick says what is there.<br><strong>Me:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Niece:</strong> And this color thing make it pretty?<br><strong>Me:</strong> That’s right.<br><strong>Niece:</strong> So HTML says what is there, and CSS makes it pretty.<br><strong>Me:</strong> Exactly.</pre>



<p>That observation presented the perfect opportunity to clarify the separation between the HTML and CSS. HTML describes what exists in the document tree. CSS describes how those elements should appear. Without styling, every element is technically present but visually absent.</p>



<p>“Now it looks <em>real</em>!” she declared. She even pointed to the drawers in the room we were in and related them to the structure of boxes and the decorations that made them look the way they were.</p>



<p>HTML lays down the pieces and CSS brings them to life with lines, colors, and other bits of decoration and positioning. This can still feel magical even to us, right? Getting my niece to this point reminded me why even the basics of what we do is satisfying.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-i-learned-from-a-five-year-old">What I learned from a five-year old</h3>


<p>“Now I can do computer, too!” she announced. That’s when my niece decided she was satisfied and bounced out of the room. I kept the little house on my screen for a while longer and thought about the exchange.</p>



<p>It’s easy to get into a rut where the magic of what we do is superseded by other things. We have a job we need to do and we sweep away the “boring” stuff to get things done. And once those things are done, how often do we pause and actually look at what we’re doing, line by line?</p>



<p>That’s the biggest thing I learned from my five-year old niece: there’s still magic in what we do, no matter how big or small the task. We might spend hours in blog posts and social threads getting pedantic about preferred toolsets, specific techniques, what’s considered best practice, and how things should be named. And, yes, these do matter matter. But the brief time I spent with my niece felt more important, meaningful, and satisfying than anything else. Strip everything away and the <a href="https://remysharp.com/2016/01/20/why-i-love-working-with-the-web" rel="noopener">web still runs on something simple</a>.</p>



<p>Those few boxes with color on them capture my attention longer than the assignment I was supposed to be doing. I don’t even know why I kept staring at it. Maybe because I realized I rush through these basics without even noticing. That moment sort of pushed me to slow down and actually look at what I was doing, line by line, instead of jumping straight to the point.</p>



<p>HTML suddenly looks less like code and more like building materials to me. CSS, meanwhile, not only steps in with a paint brush, but has the ability to mold those materials into beautiful shapes like clay.</p>



<p>So, even though my niece came to me to help her understand HTML and CSS, she was actually the one who taught me a thing or two about it. It was the way she looked at the page and saw a house that made things click more succinctly for me than how I’ve heard or read it anywhere else. The way she articulated the relationship between HTML and CSS cut straight to the point in a way nothing else has for me.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-would-you-explain-it-">How would you explain it?</h3>


<p>Taking time to explain the basics of HTML and CSS proved to me that teaching what we do — or anything, really — reveals what we know and especially what we assume we know. Teaching someone who has never seen or written a single line of code forces you to check yourself. Apparently, that’s what <a href="https://www.mometrix.com/blog/the-feynman-technique/" rel="noopener">The Feynman Technique</a> for learning is all about: teaching to learn.</p>



<p>Learning is a subjective journey rather than a one-size-fits-all sort of deal. Some of us learn visually, some learn by reading, and others learn through activity. And, naturally, something like age drastically impacts things. Adults come in with way more context and experience than a child, even if that context and experience has nothing to do with writing code. So, while I might have taken a more technical route with an adult, perhaps, finding an analogy that resonates with something my niece relates to was the way more effective path for her, even if it didn’t really require writing code.</p>



<p>Which begs me to ask the question: How would you have approached explaining HTML and CSS to my niece? Or maybe not my niece, but a five-year old in your life that you know? What analogies would you use, if any? I think it would be very cool for you to take time to do exactly that and reflect on exactly what you said. What does that tell you about what you know and assume about your work?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Web components, as imagined in 1998 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents" rel="noopener">from a never-adopted specification</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Componentization is a powerful paradigm that allows component users to build applications using &#8216;building blocks&#8217; of functionality without having to implement those building blocks themselves, or necessarily understand how the building works in fine detail. This method makes building complex applications easier by breaking them down into more manageable chunks and allowing the building blocks to be reused in other applications. </p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-390691"></span>



<p>I still think of web components as a recent feature. The first time we even took a stab at explaining them here at CSS-Tricks was in a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/">five-part series by Caleb Williams back in 2019</a>. John Rhea followed that up with another <a href="https://css-tricks.com/web-components-are-easier-than-you-think/">six-part series in 2021</a>. Not that long ago.</p>



<p>But nay! Jay Hoffman dug up the 1998 proposal cited above and shared it with me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJlhzxVftCk&amp;list=PL_BRVuWxk8sr7N-e2JT5R2fDcKLvK8WIC&amp;index=1" rel="noopener">from a recent Igalia Chat</a> (which is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_BRVuWxk8sr7N-e2JT5R2fDcKLvK8WIC" rel="noopener">great podcast</a>, by the way) he had with Brian Kardell, Eric Meyer, and Jeremy Keith.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Web Backstories: Shadow DOM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJlhzxVftCk?list=PL_BRVuWxk8sr7N-e2JT5R2fDcKLvK8WIC" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>So, we&#8217;re really talking about a feature that&#8217;s been in the works for nearly <em>30 years</em>. Style encapsulation is firmly a part of the time capsule that is web history.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that we need to know any of this information today, but the context is what&#8217;s key. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the early work put into something, especially when it comes to the web which is littered with arcane artifacts in disparate places.</p>

<p>I spend an unhealthy amount of time on the typography in my designs, and if you’ve read any traditional typography books, you might remember “the measure.” If not, it’s simply the length of a line of text. But <em>measure</em> means more than that, and once you understand what it represents, it can change how you think about layout entirely.</p>



<p>But why’s it called the <em>measure</em>?</p>

<p>Before desktop publishing, typesetters worked with physical metal type. They set lines of text within a composing stick, and the width of the stick was called the measure. It was literally the space you could fit type into, and everything else on the page — from column widths to margins and gutters — was designed around it.</p>



<p>A good measure makes reading text comfortable, while a bad one makes it more difficult.</p>

<p>And when the measure is correct, the rest of the layout falls into place. So, rather than allowing layout to dictate the measure, doesn’t it make more sense for the measure to inform layout decisions?</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="turning-the-measure-into-a-custom-property">Turning the measure into a custom property</h3>


<p>In my CSS, I start by defining a custom property:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">:root {
  --measure: 60ch;
}</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-length-units/"><code>ch</code> units</a> are ideal for this because they relate to the width of the zero (<code>0</code>) character in a chosen font. Somewhere between 60–70 characters per line is a comfortable reading length, so 65 characters feels natural.</p>



<p><code>60ch</code> is a solid starting point, but it isn’t universal. Different typefaces produce different real-world line lengths, even when the character count stays the same. Typefaces with a large x-height appear visually larger, so <code>60ch</code> can feel longer than it really is. Condensed faces make <code>60ch</code> feel too short. Wider faces can make it feel too long. Even small tracking changes stretch or compress the perceived measure.</p>



<p><strong>The point is simple:</strong> treat <code>60ch</code> as a baseline, then adjust by eye. Once the measure becomes a variable, you can use it across your layout to keep everything connected.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="keeping-text-readable">Keeping text readable</h3>


<p>I suspect most developers have used the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/max-width/"><code>max-width</code></a> property. Although it took time to retrain my muscle memory, I now use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-logical-properties-and-values/">CSS logical properties</a>, replacing <code>max-width</code> with <code>max-inline-size</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">article {
  max-inline-size: var(--measure);
  margin-inline: auto;
}</code></pre>

<p>That prevents long-line syndrome, which afflicts too many websites when viewed on large screens.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="designing-multi-column-text">Designing multi-column text</h3>


<p>Multi-column layout is one of the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-css-multi-column-layout/">most underrated CSS layout tools</a>. Instead of specifying the number of columns, defining the column width lets the browser decide how many columns fit along the inline axis. The measure can also define the widths of those columns:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">article {
  column-width: var(--measure);
}</code></pre>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1440" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s_56AFCBE7DCEED351817E3696EEEE003B5BEE9737CDC6205474FB62E233A2CF20_1763563177425_2025-11-19-3.webp?resize=1440%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="A heading and three paragraphs of text in white against a background and split into two equal-sized columns." class="wp-image-390487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s_56AFCBE7DCEED351817E3696EEEE003B5BEE9737CDC6205474FB62E233A2CF20_1763563177425_2025-11-19-3.webp?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s_56AFCBE7DCEED351817E3696EEEE003B5BEE9737CDC6205474FB62E233A2CF20_1763563177425_2025-11-19-3.webp?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s_56AFCBE7DCEED351817E3696EEEE003B5BEE9737CDC6205474FB62E233A2CF20_1763563177425_2025-11-19-3.webp?resize=1024%2C427&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s_56AFCBE7DCEED351817E3696EEEE003B5BEE9737CDC6205474FB62E233A2CF20_1763563177425_2025-11-19-3.webp?resize=768%2C320&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The measure can define multi columns widths.&nbsp;<a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/lab/measure.html#example-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See this example in my lab</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the columns’ parent container becomes wide enough, a browser flows text into as many readable columns as will fit. When there’s not enough space for multiple columns, the layout falls back to a single column, all without breakpoints and media queries.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="letting-the-measure-influence-a-grid">Letting the measure influence a grid</h3>


<p>The measure also helps me design grids which feel connected to my content. For example, when I’m implementing a layout with a column containing long-form content, plus another flexible column, I can lock the text content to the measure:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(0, var(--measure)) 1fr;
}</code></pre>

<p>That first column ensures that reading text remains comfortable, while the second adjusts to whatever horizontal space remains.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="measure-driven-container-queries">Measure-driven container queries</h3>


<p>For years, developers learned to think of screen sizes in terms of specific breakpoints (<code>320px</code>, <code>48em</code>, <code>64em</code>, and so on) and media queries. It’s a hard habit to break and one which, to be honest, I haven’t always managed myself.</p>



<p>Those numbers don’t come from content; <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/">devices define them</a>. They really should be called “guesspoints” because we mostly never know which numbers work for most people. Instead of dictating that a layout switches at, say, <code>48em</code> and <code>64em</code>, I can let my content decide when a layout should change by using the measure.</p>

<p><strong>Measure makes a better breakpoint</strong>. A measure-driven breakpoint, combined with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/">container queries</a>, responds to text content. So, when a column becomes narrower than a readable line length, a layout can collapse. But when it becomes wide enough to support more structure, the layout can expand.</p>



<p>A CSS container query checks the width of the component’s container instead of a screen or the viewport. For instance, when a component is narrower than 65 characters, I can apply specific styles:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* When the container is no wider than the --measure */
@container (max-width: var(--measure)) {
  /* Styles */
}</code></pre>



<p>My design might include multiple columns, perhaps a wider column for the main content and a narrower one for supporting information:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">[data-layout="yogi"] {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>If the container can’t support a text column equal to the measure, this query replaces the two columns with a single column layout:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@container (max-width: var(--measure)) {
  [data-layout="yogi"] {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This feels more natural because the composition is connected to the content rather than the device’s width, creating a comfortable reading environment.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-a-measure-system">Making a measure system</h3>


<p>Depending on the variety of content I need to present, on certain projects, I define several variations of the measure:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">:root {
  --measure: 60ch;
  --measure-s: 55ch;
  --measure-l: 80ch;
}</code></pre>



<p>This gives me a variety of line lengths for use in different situations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Small for captions and other shorter text blocks</li>



<li>Regular for body copy</li>



<li>Large for introductions, headings, and hero sections</li>
</ul>



<p>When type, spacing, and layout all share the same underlying rhythm, the result can feel more coherent and more intentional.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="considering-the-measure-can-change-how-you-design">Considering the measure can change how you design</h3>


<p>When you design with the measure in mind, layout stops being guesswork and becomes a conversation between content and composition. Reading becomes more comfortable, and the page feels more deliberate. It’s a small shift, but once you start anchoring your design decisions to the measure, it changes how you approach layout entirely.</p>

<p>Read you a story? What fun would that be? I&#8217;ve got a better idea: let&#8217;s tell a story together.</p>
<cite>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopia" rel="noopener">Photopia</a> <a href="https://adamcadre.ac/if/photopia.html" rel="noopener"></a>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Cadre" rel="noopener">Adam Cadre</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Do you think of scrolling as a more modern way of reading than turning pages in a book? Nope, the concept originated in ancient Egypt, and it’s older than what we now classify as books. It’s based on how our ancestors read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll" rel="noopener">ancient physical scrolls</a>, the earliest form of editable text in the history of writing. I am Jewish, so I remember my earliest non-digital scrolling experience was horizontally scrolling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" rel="noopener">Torah</a>, which can be more <a href="https://www.reconstructingjudaism.org/article/holding-torah-in-our-hands/" rel="noopener">immersive</a> than traditionally scrolling a webpage. The physical actions to navigate texts have captured the imagination of many a storyteller, leading authors to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure" rel="noopener">gamify the act of turning pages</a> and to create stories that incorporate the <a href="https://donotopenthisbook.com/" rel="noopener">physical actions of opening a book and turning pages</a> as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_on_a_winter%27s_night_a_traveler" rel="noopener">narrative</a>. However, innovative experiences using non-standard scrolling haven’t been explored as thoroughly.</p>

<p>I can sympathize with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1drlxdv/why_the_fuck_do_all_the_fancy_websites_feel_the/" rel="noopener">those who</a> dismiss <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrollytelling" rel="noopener">scrollytelling</a> as a gimmick: it can be an annoyance if it’s just for the sake of cleverness, but my favorite examples I’ve seen over the years tell <a href="https://www.designrush.com/best-designs/websites/the-walking-dead-zombiefied" rel="noopener">stories we couldn’t otherwise</a>. There’s something uniquely immersive about stories driven by a mechanic that has lived in our species&#8217; collective muscle memory since ancient days.</p>



<p>Still unconvinced of the value of scrollytelling? Alright, hypothetical annoying skeptic, let’s first warm up with some common use cases for scroll-based styling.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="popular-scroll-based-designs-we-can-simplify-with-modern-css">Popular scroll-based designs we can simplify with modern CSS</h3>


<p>It’s awesome that Chrome has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/unleash-the-power-of-scroll-driven-animations/">solid support</a> for native scroll-driven animations without requiring JavaScript, and we see that both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-technology-preview-release-notes/stp-release-215#New-Features" rel="noopener">Safari</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features#scroll-driven_animations" rel="noopener">Firefox</a> are actively working on support for the new scroll-driven standards. These new features facilitate optimized, smooth scroll-driven animations. The support via pure CSS syntax makes scroll-driven animation a more approachable option for designers who may be more comfortable with CSS than with the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/scroll-animation-performance-case-study#new_scroll-driven_animations_javascript_api_versus_classic_javascript" rel="noopener">equivalent JavaScript</a>.</p>



<p>Indeed, even though I am a full-stack developer who is <a href="https://www.andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html" rel="noopener">supposed to know everything</a>, I found having scroll-driven animation built into the browser and available with a few lines of CSS gets my <a href="https://css-tricks.com/slide-through-unlimited-dimensions-with-css-scroll-timelines/">creativity flowing</a>, inspiring me to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/web-slinger-css-like-wow-js-but-with-css-y-scroll-animations/">experiment</a> more than if I had to go through hoops of a proprietary <a href="https://simpleparallax.com/" rel="noopener">library</a> and writing JavaScript, which in the past might include messing with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API" rel="noopener">intersection observer</a> and fiddly code.</p>



<p>If animation timelines weren’t enough, Chrome has now introduced support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_overflow/CSS_carousels" rel="noopener">CSS carousel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DavMila/explainer-scroll-initial-target" rel="noopener"><code>scroll-initial-target</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries" rel="noopener"><code>scroll-state</code> queries</a>—all of which provide opportunities to control scrolling behaviors in CSS and style all the things based on scrolling.</p>



<p>In my opinion, <code>scroll-state</code> is more of an evolutionary than revolutionary addition to the growing range of scroll-related CSS features. Animation timelines are so powerful that they can be hacked to achieve many of the same effects we can implement with <code>scroll-state</code> queries. Therefore, think of <code>scroll-state</code> as a highly convenient, simplified subset of what we can do in more verbose hacky ways with animation timelines and/or view timelines.</p>



<p>Some examples of effects <code>scroll-state</code> simplifies are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Before <code>scroll-state</code> queries existed, you could hack <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-timeline" rel="noopener">view progress timelines</a> to create scroll-triggered animations, but we now have <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries#snapped" rel="noopener">snapped</a> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries#snapped" rel="noopener"><code>scroll-state</code> queries</a> to achieve <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries#animating_in_slide_elements" rel="noopener">similar effects</a>.</li>



<li>Before <code>snapped</code> queries existed, Bramus demonstrated a hack <a href="https://www.bram.us/2023/06/26/faking-a-snapped-selector-with-scroll-driven-animations/https://www.bram.us/2023/06/26/faking-a-snapped-selector-with-scroll-driven-animations/" rel="noopener">to simulate a hypothetical <code>:snapped</code></a> selector using scroll-driven animations.</li>



<li>Before <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Container_scroll-state_queries#using_scrollable_queries" rel="noopener"><code>scrollable</code> queries</a> existed, Bramus <a href="https://www.bram.us/2023/09/16/solved-by-css-scroll-driven-animations-detect-if-an-element-can-scroll-or-not/" rel="noopener">showed how we could do similar things</a> using <code>scroll-timeline.</code></li>
</ol>



<p>Take a moment to appreciate that Bramus is from the future, and to reflect on how <code>scroll-state</code> can simplify common UI patterns, such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/scroll-shadows/">scroll shadows</a>, which Chris Coyier said might be his “favorite CSS trick of all time.” This year, Kevin Hamer <a href="https://css-tricks.com/modern-scroll-shadows-using-scroll-driven-animations/">showed</a> how <code>scroll-timeline</code> can achieve scroll shadows in CSS with fewer tricks. It’s excellent, but the only thing better than clever CSS tricks is that scroll shadows no longer require a trick at all. Hacking CSS is fun, but there is something to be said for that warm fuzzy feeling that CSS was made just for your use case. This <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries#indicate_scroll_with_shadows" rel="noopener">demo</a> from the Chrome blog shows how scroll shadows and other visual affordances are easy to implement with <code>scroll-state</code>.</p>



<p>But the popularity of Kevin’s article suggests that normal, sane people will gravitate to practical use cases for the new CSS scroll-based features. In fact, a normal and sane author might end the article here. Unfortunately, as I revealed in a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/worlds-collide-keyframe-collision-detection-using-style-queries/">previous article</a>, I have been cursed by a spooky shopkeeper who sells CSS tricks at a haunted carnival, so I now roam the earth attempting the unthinkable with pure CSS.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="decision-time">Decision time</h3>


<p><em>As you reach this paragraph in the article, you realize that when you scroll, it fast-forwards reality. Therefore, after we end the discussion of scroll shadows, the shadows swallow the world outside your window, except for two glowing words hovering near your house: CSS TRICKS. You wander out through your front door and meet a street vendor standing beneath the neon sign. The letters give her multiple shadows as if she has thrown them down like discarded masks, undecided about which shade of night to wear. On the table before her lies a weathered scroll. It unrolls on its own, whispering misremembered fragments from a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/worlds-collide-keyframe-collision-detection-using-style-queries/">forgotten CSS-Tricks article</a>: “A scroll trigger is a point of no return, like a trap sprung once the hapless user scrolls past a certain point.”</em></p>



<p><em>The neon flickers like a glitch, revealing another of the shopkeeper’s faces: a fire demon doppleganger of yourself who is the villain of the CodePen we’ll descend into if you scroll further.</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Will you continue?&#8221; the fire demon hisses. &#8220;Will you scroll deeper into the madness at the far edges of CSS?</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="non-linear-scrollytelling">Non-linear scrollytelling</h3>


<p>Evidently, you are game to play with fire, so check out the pure CSS experiment below, which demonstrates a technique I call “nonlinear scrollytelling,” in which the user controls the outcome of a visual story by deciding which direction to scroll next. It’s a scrolling <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>. But if your browser is less adventurous than you are, watch the screen recording instead. The experiment will only work on Chromium-based browsers for now, because it relies on <code>scroll-state</code>, <code>animation-timeline</code>, <code>scroll-initial-target</code> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/if-article" rel="noopener">CSS inline conditionals</a>.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen this technique in the wild, so let me know in the comments if you have seen other examples of the idea. For now, I’ll claim credit for pioneering the mechanics — but I give credit to the talented <a href="https://deadrevolver.thousand-pixel.com/" rel="noopener">Dead Revolver</a> for creating the awesome, affordable <a href="https://itch.io/s/130900/platformer-bundle" rel="noopener">pixel art bundle</a> I used for most of the graphics. The animated lightsaber icon was ripped from this cool <a href="https://codepen.io/andy1729/pen/GZBBZX" rel="noopener">CodePen</a> by Ujjawal Anand, and I used ChatGPT to draw the climbable building. To make the bad guy, I reused the same spritesheet from the player character, but I implemented the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" rel="noopener">Mirror Match trope</a> from Mortal Kombat, using color shifting to create a “new” character who I <a href="https://miraculousladybug.fandom.com/wiki/Kamiko" rel="noopener">evilized</a> by casting the following spell in CSS:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.evil-twin {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  filter: invert(24%) sepia(99%) saturate(5431%) hue-rotate(354deg) brightness(93%) contrast(122%);
  background-image: url(/* same spritesheet as the player character */);
}</code></pre>



<p>It’s cool that CSS helps recycle existing assets for those like me who are drawing-challenged. I also wanted to make sure that well-supported CSS features like <code>transform</code> and <code>filter</code> didn’t feel left out of the fun in an experiment filled with newer, emergent CSS features.</p>



<p>But if you’ve come this far, you’re probably eager to understand the scroll-related CSS logic.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="our-story-begins-in-the-middle-of-the-end">Our story begins in the middle of the end</h3>


<p>You may have noticed our experiment earns extra crazy points as soon as it loads, by starting at the middle of the bottom of the page so that the player can choose whether to scroll left to run away, or scroll right to walk unarmed towards the bad guy if the player wants to compete with the madness level of the game’s creator.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/DavMila/explainer-scroll-initial-target" rel="noopener">This explainer for the emergent <code>scroll-initial-target</code> property</a> shows that controlling scroll position on load was previously possible by hacking CSS animations and the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/scroll-snap-align/"><code>scroll-snap-align</code></a> property. However, similar to what we discussed above about the value proposition of <code>scroll-state</code>, a feature like <code>scroll-initial-target</code> is exciting because it simplifies something that previously required verbose, fragile hacks, which can now be replaced with more succinct and reliable CSS:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.spawn-point {
  position: absolute;
  left: 400vw;
  scroll-initial-target: nearest;
}</code></pre>



<p>As cool as this is, we should only subvert expectations for how a webpage behaves if we have a sufficient reason. For instance, CSS like the above could have simplified <a href="https://css-tricks.com/web-slinger-css-across-the-swiper-verse/">my pure CSS swiper experiment</a>, but Chrome <a href="https://webstatus.dev/features/scroll-initial-target" rel="noopener">only added <code>scroll-initial-target</code> in February 2025</a>, the month after I wrote that article. Using <code>scroll-initial-target</code> would be justified in the swiper scenario, since the crux of that design was that the user started in the middle with the option to swipe left or right.</p>



<p>A similar dilemma is central to the opening of our scrollytelling narrative. The disorienting experience of finding ourselves in an unexpected scroll position with only the option to scroll horizontally heightens the drama, as the user has to adapt to an unusual way of interacting while the bad guy rapidly approaches. I’m feeling generous, so let’s give the user 20 seconds to figure it out, but you can experiment with different timeframes by editing the <code>--chase-time</code> custom property at the top of the source file.</p>



<p>We’re going to create a CSS implementation of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/1cwinkn/general_horror_how_do_slow_walking_stalking/" rel="noopener">slasher movie trope in which a walking aggressor can’t be outrun</a>. We do that by marking the bad guy as <code>position: fixed</code>, then adding an infinite walk-cycle animation and another animation that moves him relentlessly from right to left across the screen. Meanwhile, we give the player character a running animation and position him based on a horizontal animation timeline. He can run, but he can’t hide.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  .idle {
    animation: idleAnim 1s steps(6) infinite;
  }

    /* --scroll-direction is populated using the clever property Bramus demonstrates 
  here https://www.bram.us/2023/10/23/css-scroll-detection */

  .sprite {
    transform: rotateY(calc(1deg * min(0, var(--scroll-direction) * 180)));
  }

  @container not style(--scroll-direction: 0) {
    .sprite {
      animation: runAnim 0.8s steps(8) infinite;
    }
  }

  .evil-twin-wrapper {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 5px;
    z-index: 1000;
    margin-left: var(--enemy-x-offset);
    /* we'll explain later how we detect the way the game should end */
    --follow: if(style(--game-state: ending): paused; else: running); 
    animation: var(--chase-time) forwards linear evil-twin-chase var(--follow);
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>He can’t hide, but we’ll next introduce a second scroll-based decision point using <code>scroll-state</code> to detect when our hero has been backed into a corner and see if we can help him.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-scroll-state-could-save-your-life">How <code>scroll-state</code> could save your life</h3>


<p>As our hero runs away to the left, the buildings and sky in the cityscape background show off a few layers of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bringing-back-parallax-with-scroll-driven-css-animations/">parallax scrolling</a> by assigning each layer an anonymous animation timeline and an animation that moves each layer faster than the layer behind it.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.sky, .buildings-back, .buildings-mid, .sky-vertical, .buildings-back-vertical, .buildings-mid-vertical {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 800%;
  height: max(100vh, 300px);
  background-size: auto max(100vh, 300px);
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-timeline: scroll(x);
}

/*...repetitively assign the corresponding animations to each layer...*/

@keyframes move-sky {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(-2.5%);
  }
}

@keyframes move-back {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(-6.25%);
  }
}

@keyframes move-mid {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(-12.5%);
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This usage of animation timelines is what they were designed for, which is why the code is straightforward. If we had to, we could push the boundaries and use the same technique to set a Houdini variable in an animation timeline to detect when the player reaches the left corner of the screen — but thanks to <code>scroll-state</code> queries, we have a cleaner option.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@container scroll-state((scrollable: left)) {
  body {
    overflow-y: hidden;
  }
}

@container scroll-state((scrollable: bottom)) {
  body {
    width: 0;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s all we need to toggle vertical and horizontal scrolling based on position! This is the basis that allows the player to escape from being slashed by the bad guy. Now we can scroll up and down to climb the ladder only when the player reaches the left corner where the ladder is, and disallow horizontal scrolling while he is climbing.</p>



<p>I could have made the game detect reaching the left of the screen using animation timelines, but that would involve <a href="https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/scroll-triggered-animations-style-queries/" rel="noopener">custom property toggles</a>, which are more verbose and error-prone.</p>



<p>When the player climbs to the top of the ladder to collect the lightsaber, we do need one toggle property so the game will remember we have collected the weapon, but it’s simpler than if we had used animation timelines.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@keyframes collect-saber {
  from {
    --player-has-saber: false;
  }
  to {
    --player-has-saber: true;
  }
}

body {
  animation: .25s forwards var(--saber-collection-state, paused) collect-saber;
}

@container scroll-state(not (scrollable: top)) {
  body {
    --saber-collection-state: running;
  }
}


@container style(--player-has-saber: true) {
  .sprite {
    background-image: url(/*combat spritesheet*/);
  }

  .lightsaber {
    visibility: hidden;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>Contrariwise, the animation cycle while the sprite is climbing the ladder is a job for <code>animation-timeline</code> used to assign an anonymous vertical timeline to the player sprite. This is applied conditionally when our <code>scroll-state</code> query detects that the player is between the bottom and the top of the ladder. It’s a nice example of how animation timelines and <code>scroll-state</code> queries are good at different things, and work well together.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@container scroll-state((scrollable: top) and ((scrollable: bottom))) {
  .player-wrapper {
    .sprite {
      animation: climbAnim 1s steps(8);
      animation-timeline: scroll(root y);
      animation-iteration-count: 10;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="finish-him-with-fatal-conditionality">Finish him with fatal conditionality</h3>


<p>We apply the techniques I discovered in my <a href="https://css-tricks.com/worlds-collide-keyframe-collision-detection-using-style-queries/">CSS collision detection article</a> to detect when the two characters meet for their showdown. At that point, we want to disable scrolling entirely and display the appropriate non-interactive endgame <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" rel="noopener">cutscene</a> depending on the choices our user made. Notice that if we detect the good guy won, he only strikes with the sword once, whereas the bad guy will continue to slash infinitely, even after the good guy is dead. What can I say — I was working on this CodePen around Halloween.</p>



<p>In the past, I wrote an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-what-if-machine-bringing-the-iffy-future-of-css-into-the-present/">article questioning the need for inline CSS conditionals</a> — but now that they’ve <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lightly-poking-at-the-css-if-function-in-chrome-137/">landed in Chrome</a>, I find them addictive, especially when creating a heavily conditional CSS experiment like nonlinear scrollytelling. I like to imagine that the new <code>if()</code> function stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction" rel="noopener">Interactive Fiction</a>. Below is how I detect the endgame conditions and choose which animations to play in the final cutscene. I am not sure of the most readable way to space out <code>if()</code> code in CSS, so feel free to start holy wars on that topic in the comments.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  --min-of-player-and-enemy-x: min(var(--player-x-offset), var(--enemy-x-offset) - 10px);
  --max-of-player-and-enemy-y: max(var(--player-y-offset, 5px));
  --game-state:
    if(
      style(--min-of-player-and-enemy-x: calc(var(--enemy-x-offset) - 10px)) and style(--max-of-player-and-enemy-y: 5px): 
        ending; 
      else: 
        playing
    );
  overflow:
    if(
      style(--game-state: ending): 
        hidden; 
      else: 
        scroll
    );
}

@container style(--player-has-saber: true) and style(--game-state: ending) {
  .player-wrapper {
    .sprite {
      animation: attack 0.7s steps(4) forwards;
    }

  .speech-bubble {
    animation: show-endgame-message 3s linear 1s forwards;

    &amp;::before {
      content: 'Refresh the page to play again';
    }
  }
    
  .evil-twin-wrapper {
    .evil-twin {
      evil-twin-die 0.8s steps(4) .7s forwards;
    }
  }
}

@container style(--player-has-saber: false) and style(--game-state: ending) {
  .player-wrapper {
    .sprite {
      animation: player-die .8s steps(6) .7s forwards;
    }
  }

  .evil-twin-wrapper {
    .speech-bubble {
      animation: show-endgame-message 3s linear 1s forwards;
      display: block;

      &amp;::before {
        content: 'Baha! Refresh the page to fight me again';
      }
      .evil-twin {
        attack 0.8s steps(4) infinite;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="should-we-non-linearly-scrollytell-all-the-things-">Should we non-linearly scrollytell all the things?</h3>


<p>I am glad you asked, hypothetical troll who wrote that heading. Of course, even putting the technical challenges aside, you know that this won’t always be the right approach for a website. As Andy Clarke recently pointed out here on CSS-Tricks, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/getting-creative-with-small-screens/">design is storytelling</a>. The needs of every story are different, but I found my little pixel art guy’s <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/story-arcs" rel="noopener">emotional story arc</a> requires non-linear scrollytelling.</p>



<p>I think this particular example isn’t a gimmick and is a legitimate form of web design expression. The demo tells a simple story, but my wife pointed out that a personal situation I am dealing with has strong analogies to the pixel guy’s journey. He finds himself in a situation where the only sane option is to allow himself to be backed into a corner, but when all seems lost, he finds a way to rise above the adversity. Then he learns that the moral high ground is its own form of trap, so he must put his own spin on the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/428786-to-know-your-enemy-you-must-become-your-enemy" rel="noopener">wisdom of Sun Tzu</a> that “to know your enemy, you must become your enemy.” He apparently lowers himself back to the aggressor’s level — but he only does what is necessary. The bitterwseet moral is that survival sometimes requires taking a leaf out of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539039-the-wisdom-of-psychopaths" rel="noopener">enemy’s book</a> — but the user has been guiding the hero through this story, which helps the audience to understand that the good guy&#8217;s motivations are not comparable to those of his adversary. While testing the CodePen, I found the story moving and even suspenseful in an 8-bit nostalgia kind of way, even if some of that suspense was my uncertainty about whether I would get it working.</p>



<p>From a technical point of view, I think building a full-scale website based on this idea would require a mix of CSS and JavaScript, because storing state in CSS currently requires hacks (like <a href="https://odland.dev/2023/06/18/scroll-persisted-state.html" rel="noopener">this one</a>, which is cool but also highly experimental). The paused animation approach to remember that the player collected the sword can glitch due to timer drift, so there is a small chance the dude will start the game with the lightsaber already in his hand! If you resize the window during the endgame, you can glitch the game, and then things get really weird. By contrast, something like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap/Using_scroll_snap_events" rel="noopener">scroll snap events</a> — already supported in Chrome — would allow us to store state and even play sounds using a script that fires based on scroll interactions.</p>



<p>It seems like we already have enough in CSS to build a site like <a href="https://www.prevint.pt/en/" rel="noopener">this one</a>, which uses horizontal multimedia scrollytelling to raise awareness that interpersonal violence exists on a continuum and tends to escalate if the target is unable to recognize the early warning signs. That’s a worthy topic I <a href="https://css-tricks.com/applying-the-web-dev-mindset-to-dealing-with-life-challenges/">unfortunately have some experience with</a>, and the usage of horizontal scrollytelling to address it demonstrates that a wide variety of stories can be told engagingly through scrollytelling.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Chrome 144 features a small change to <code>overscroll-behavior</code>: it now also works on non-scrollable scroll containers. While this change might seem trivial, it fixes an issue developers have been dealing with for ages: prevent a page from scrolling while a <em>(modal)</em> <code>&lt;dialog></code> is open.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-390613"></span>



<p>YES! Way back in 2019, I worked on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/prevent-page-scrolling-when-a-modal-is-open/">&#8220;Prevent Page Scrolling When a Modal is Open&#8221;</a> with Brad Wu about this exact thing. Apparently this was mere months before <a href="https://css-tricks.com/some-hands-on-with-the-html-dialog-element/">we got our hands on the true HTML <code>&lt;dialog></code> element</a>. In any case, you can see the trouble with active scrolling when a &#8220;dialog&#8221; is open:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_KLGKqJ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/KLGKqJ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=KLGKqJ&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed KLGKqJ" title="CodePen Embed KLGKqJ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The problem is that the dialog itself is not a scroll container. If it was, we could slap <code>overscroll-behavior: contain</code> on it and be done with it. Brad demoed his solution  that involved a JavaScript-y approach that sets the <code>&lt;body></code> to fixed positioning when the dialog is in an open state:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_LogERe" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/LogERe?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=LogERe&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed LogERe" title="CodePen Embed LogERe" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>That&#8217;s the tweak Bramus is talking about. In Chrome 144, that&#8217;s no longer the case. Going back to that first demo, we can do a couple of things to avoid all the JS mumbo-jumbo.</p>



<p>First, we declare <code>overscroll-behavior</code> on both the dialog element and the backdrop and set it to <code>contain</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}

#dialog {
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}</code></pre>



<p>You&#8217;d think that would do it, but there&#8217;s a super key final step. That dialog needs to be a scroll container, which we can do explicitly:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">#dialog {
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
  overflow: hidden;
}</code></pre>



<p>Chrome 144 needed, of course:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_WbwzERb" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/WbwzERb?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=WbwzERb&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed WbwzERb" title="CodePen Embed WbwzERb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The demo that Bramus provided is much, much better as it deals with the actual HTML <code>&lt;dialog></code> element and its <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/pseudo-selectors/b/backdrop/">::backdrop</a></code>:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QwNMroY" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QwNMroY?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QwNMroY&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QwNMroY" title="CodePen Embed QwNMroY" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>
