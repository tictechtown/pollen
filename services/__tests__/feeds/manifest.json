          "title": "No, the Poverty Line Isn’t $140,000 a Year",
          "description": "A few weeks ago, Michael Green <a href=\"https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-1-my-life-is-a-lie\">published a post</a> where he argued that the poverty line for a family of four in the U.S. wasn't $32,100 in annual income (<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">as currently claimed by the Department of Health and Human Services</a>), but closer to $140,000 per year.\n\nHe maintains that how poverty was determined historically (based solely on food prices) no longer holds because the costs of other necessities (namely housing, healthcare, and childcare) have gone up considerably. Therefore, a typical family of four needs far more income to participate in society today than they would've needed a few decades ago.\n\nI believe that this thesis is fundamentally correct and the real poverty line is much higher than the $32,100 figure provided by the DHHS. However, how Green goes from this correct diagnosis to a revised $140,000 per year \"poverty line\" is flawed in many ways.\n\nI have no interest in taking apart the $140,000 figure because others have <a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-140000-poverty-line-is-very-silly\">thoroughly debunked it already</a>, and even Green himself <a href=\"https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-2-the-door-has-opened\">revised it down to $94,000 one week later</a>. That alone should illustrate how outlandish his original $140k poverty line estimate was.\n\nHowever, even Green's more reasonable $94,000 poverty line for a family of four is still slightly exaggerated. The problem with this number isn't the data Green uses, but how he applies it.\n\nIronically, Green bashes economists for championing rising home prices and 401(k) balances as signs of improving wealth, but, with similar naiveté, assumes that everyone <em>pays the average price</em> for all their goods and services. But they don't. In the real world, the costs associated with things like childcare and housing vary significantly and can be much lower than <em>the average</em>. \n\nFor example, I know a woman who is unmarried with three children. Her and her boyfriend both work and they each make less than $20 an hour. As a result, their household income is less than $80,000 per year.\n\nAccording to Green, this family would be struggling just trying to keep up with their childcare costs. Is that what happens in practice? No. When their children aren't in school, they stay with the woman's mother. So that hypothetical $32,000 in childcare costs (for two children) goes to $0 (for three children). While not everyone has this luxury, millions do, and a poverty metric that ignores the informal economy overlooks how the working class actually survives.\n\nMore importantly, if she didn't have her mother there, she could consider other relatives to watch her kids or pay someone to watch them for far less than $32,000 per year. Most people aren't isolated economic units. They exist within a broader network of friends and family that can provide real economic value that offsets some of these costs.\n\nI understand that this is just one anecdote, but it exemplifies the logical flaw in Green's argument. He assumes that people will willingly go to work, earn a low wage, and then spend it all on childcare (i.e., pay the average price). No, they won't! If the second earner doesn't make enough, they will stay home and watch the kids. Or they will only work part time (nights/weekends). Or they will find a cheaper childcare arrangement.\n\nThis demonstrates that there's a big difference between the <i>formal</i> market and the <i>informal</i> market, especially for childcare. Green's analysis assumes that everyone pays the sticker price at a licensed daycare center (i.e., the formal market). But in reality, millions of families operate in the informal market, utilizing grandparents, neighbors, or split-shifts to reduce their childcare cost significantly.\n\nThe same logic applies for housing as well. For example, the average price for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City <a href=\"https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/new-york-ny/\">is around $4,000</a>. If we assumed that everyone in NYC paid <em>that price</em> for housing, then it would be easy to argue that lots of people in NYC are in deep poverty.\n\nHowever, if you actually look at the data, the <em>median</em> rent paid for an apartment in NYC is <a href=\"https://www.maximumnewyork.com/p/nycs-median-rent-is-16k-and-how-that\">only $1,650 per month across 2.3 million rental units</a>. How is that possible? Because this figure includes rent-stabilized units, rent-controlled units, and public housing units which are much cheaper than market rate apartments. When we use the <em>average</em> market rate, we skew this number upward and exclude over half of NYC's housing stock.\n\nAnd that's just what's in the formal housing market. There are many informal housing arrangements that fly below the radar that are much cheaper as well. For example, one of my wife's friends shares a room in Brooklyn with two other people and only pays $500 a month. While this is a bit extreme, she's living in Brooklyn for only $500 a month! These kinds of housing situations are unlikely to be in the data, but they exist nonetheless.\n\nI understand that the NYC housing market is very different from the rest of the U.S., but it demonstrates that housing options are far more diverse than what \"the average\" suggests. The same goes for childcare.\n\nAs a result, many families can get by on much less than what Green assumes. Does that mean that the poverty line for a family of four is only $32,100? No. It's definitely more than double that.\n\nBut is that really a surprise? If low skilled workers now earn $20 an hour (~$40,000 per year), is it unreasonable to expect people to earn more than that to raise a family of four?  I don't know. Unfortunately, questions like this are more ethical than financial in nature, which isn't my area of expertise.\n\nRegardless of what you believe about the <em>true</em> poverty line, it's fair to say that it's far below $140,000. And Michael Green knows that.\n\nThe real genius of his article was saying something blatantly true <em>and</em> blatantly false at the same time. This is how you maximize engagement and go viral.\n\nWhy does this work? Because it gets those who believe the truth to come out and support you and those who think it's false to come out against you. For example, consider this image I saw on LinkedIn recently:\n\n<a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tipping_too_much.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30972\" src=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tipping_too_much.jpg\" alt=\"If you cant tip your server don't go out to eat. And then proceeds to show that someone should tip 40% on their bill.\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\"></a>\n\nThis is incredible engagement bait because it says something true (\"If you can't tip your server, don't go out to eat\") and something false (\"You should tip your server 40%\") at the same time. Max outrage. Max engagement. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nThis is basically what Green did in his original article and it worked. Multiple readers asked me about it, so I felt like I had to respond.\n\nGreen is far smarter than me and I have nothing against him. Even though I disagree with his long-held stance that <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/is-there-a-problem-with-passive-investing/\">passive indexing is in a massive bubble</a>, he's a great thinker.\n\nHowever, people are also more complicated than Green assumes. For example, you can run the numbers and declare that someone will run out of money in retirement using <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/\">the 4% Rule</a>, but they probably won't. In practice, they will cut back as their assets decline. They will change their behavior. They will adapt.\n\nThis explains why <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-do-retirees-actually-spend-their-money/\">so few people actually use the 4% Rule</a>. It's too robotic to fit actual human behavior. However, it's a great convenience for investment nerds like myself and Green. \n\nBut convenience doesn't equal truth, whether we look at the 4% Rule or the poverty line.

          "description": "With 2025 coming to an end, it’s time for my annual tradition of gathering my favorite investment writing of the year. I started this tradition in <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2017/\">2017</a>, and have continued it ever since (<a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2018/\">2018</a>, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2019/\">2019</a>, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2020/\">2020</a>, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2021/\">2021</a>, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2022/\">2022</a>, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2023/\">2023</a>, <a style=\"color: blue; \"href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2024/\">2024</a>).\n\n2025 was a year of turbulence (in April) <em>and</em> a year of growth. And though <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/there-is-no-substitute-for-thinking/\">AI has infiltrated the writing space like never before</a>, there are still many great <em>human</em> writers doing their thing. With that being said, I present my favorite investment writing of 2025:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/on-bubble-watch\">On Bubble Watch</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights\">Howard Marks</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nHoward Marks is one of the best investment writers and thinkers in our industry and this piece (which came out in early 2025) set the stage for many of the bubble discussions <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-im-bearish-on-us-stocks-for-the-second-time-since-2017/\">that followed</a> throughout the year. While Marks doesn't adamantly claim that everything is in a bubble, he does provide measured evidence illustrating how valuations seem stretched in today's environment. A great read to orient yourself as we go into 2026.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.downtownjoshbrown.com/p/why-be-an-lp-when-you-can-be-a-gp\">Why be an LP when you can be a GP? </a></strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/downtownjoshbrown/?hl=en\">Josh Brown</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nWhile Marks was discussing the possibility of a bubble in public markets, Josh Brown penned this wonderful article on what's happening in private markets. Similarly, Josh doesn't claim that private equity is bad or in a huge bubble, but rather highlights what Wall Street has done to get more investors into this historically exclusive asset class. Filled with humor and wit in equal measure, this piece is for anyone who wants to know what's been happening in private markets.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://moneywithkatie.com/essays/americas-housing-paradox-hiding-in-plain-sight/\">America's Housing Paradox, Hiding in Plain Sight</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/moneywithkatie/\">Money With Katie</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nThere were a lot of housing posts published in 2025, but this one had the most in-depth research of any I read. Quite simply, Katie Gatti Tassin <em>crushed</em> it here. If you want to know why the U.S. has a housing crisis and why it probably won't be solved anytime soon, read this piece.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/03/when-will-housing-prices-fall/\">When Will Housing Prices Fall?</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/awealthofcs\">Ben Carlson</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nEvery year I put a Ben Carlson housing piece on this list because every year he delivers. This year Ben asks, \"When will housing prices fall?\" and then answers the question with solid data and analysis. There's a reason Ben is the best housing writer in our space, and this piece illustrates why. \n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://collabfund.com/blog/pure-independence/\"><b>Pure Independence</b></a></strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/morganhousel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morgan Housel</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nYou can tell when a writer is passionate about a topic and it clearly shows here for Morgan. Not only does he define different forms of independence and why they matter, but he also demonstrates why independence is the key to producing great work. A must read for anyone trying to live life on their own terms.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://newsletter.thewayofwork.com/p/career-leverage?r=5bzu0a&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web\">Why you probably have a low leverage career (and how to create more leverage)</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@rickfoerster\">Rick Foerster</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nI discovered Rick Foerster rather recently and loved this piece on career leverage. I've <a href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-4-types-of-leverage/\">written on leverage before</a>, but this guide from Rick is far more detailed and provides a lot more high-leverage options for those looking to transform their career. If you want to understand how to earn more in the future via leverage, this is the piece to read.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.theirrelevantinvestor.com/p/how-does-the-stock-market-bottom-bf3d\">How Does the Stock Market Bottom?</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelbatnick\">Michael Batnick</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nEvery time the market crashes, Michael Batnick produces his absolute best work. The calm and collected tone during the high uncertainty back in April was something every investor needed to hear. And while the market turbulence has since passed, this is a good reminder on how the stock market tends to bottom before things get better.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/what-now-an-investors-to-do-list-chaotic-markets\">What Now? An Investor’s To-Do List for Chaotic Markets</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://x.com/christine_benz\">Christine Benz</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nRight as the market crashed in April, Christine Benz came out with this simple, yet effective reminder on what things to do during a chaotic market. This was not a piece on market timing, but a gentle reminder to have your affairs in order in case things got worse. An evergreen read whether we are experiencing a chaotic market or not.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.fortunesandfrictions.com/post/perspectives-on-market-downturns\">Perspective on Market Downturns </a></strong>(<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubinmiller/\">Rubin Miller, CFA</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nRubin Miller came out with this wonderful piece one month <em>before</em> the market crashed back in April, but it was timely nonetheless. It reads like a greatest hits of Miller's ideas on volatility, rebalancing, and much more. If you want a broader perspective on managing your portfolio during market downturns, check this one out.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.optimisticallie.com/p/invest-like-buffett\">Invest Like Buffett</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://x.com/callieabost\">Callie Cox</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nShortly after Warren Buffett announced that he was stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway, Callie Cox wrote this great article. Not only was it an ode to Buffett and his legacy, but it provides real-world takeaways on how to invest more like the Oracle of Omaha. Though the advice is deceptively simple, a periodic reminder doesn't hurt. \n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/giving-people-money-helped-less-than\">Giving people money helped less than I thought it would</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@kelseytuoc\">Kelsey Piper</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nI love evidence-based financial writing and Kelsey Piper delivers it in this one on the effectiveness of universal basic income (UBI). Historically, I was a fan of UBI, but after reading this piece it seems like the result is less promising than I would've hoped. An incredible read for anyone trying to understand where UBI helps people...and where it doesn't. \n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://kyla.substack.com/p/whos-getting-rich-off-your-attention\">Who's Getting Rich Off Your Attention</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://x.com/kylascan\">Kyla Scanlon</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nThough Kyla Scanlon is more of an economics writer, I had to include her work here because she is writing on the very topics that are impacting markets and our day-to-day lives. This one takes an in-depth look at how companies get rich off of our attention and how that landscape has evolved over the past decade. A must read for anyone trying to understand the impact of social media on our lives.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://oldcoinbad.com/p/long-degeneracy\">long degeneracy</a></strong> (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@oldcoinbad\">jez</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nI don't usually read about cryptocurrency and other forms of speculation, but this piece by \"jez\" is simply fantastic. Whether we like it or not, speculation is a large part of the investment space and this post explains why. While I don't agree with everything written here, it's a must read for those who want to know more about the non-traditional world of finance.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/daniel-kahneman-assisted-suicide-9fb16124\">The Last Decision by the World's Leading Thinker on Decisions</a> </strong>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonzweigwsj\">Jason Zweig</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nThis post isn't about investing per se, but it tackles the topics of life, death, and decision-making in an incredible way. Zweig does a great job examining Daniel Kahneman's final decision to end his life and the impact this decision had on Kahneman's friends, family, and extended community.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://humbledollar.com/forum/farewell-friends/\">Farewell Friends</a> </strong>(<a href=\"https://humbledollar.com/author/jonathan-clements/\">Jonathan Clements</a>)</li>\n</ul>\nUnfortunately, we lost a legend of financial writing in 2025—Jonathan Clements. Clements was known for his simple, clear communication around money and I enjoyed many of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XZP1dk\">his books</a>. \"Farewell Friends\" was Clements' last blog post. May he rest in peace.\n\n<hr>\n\nI hope you enjoyed this year's annual review.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n<strong>If you liked this post, consider <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/newsletter/\">signing up for my newsletter</a>.</strong>\n\nThis is post 480.

I previously increased the goal in 2022 from <code>3-5</code> to <code>20</code>.\nIn 2024, the count was at <code>10</code>.\nThings haven’t moved too much since then, but I’ll refresh next year.</p>\n<p>I think that I’m on track, but I will say that I think getting into these roles is markedly\nharder than it was three years ago. There are just fewer of these roles available recently,\nand they tend to be both more demanding and more difficult than the standard VPE/CTO role\na few years ago.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For backstory on these goals: I originally\n<a href=\"https://lethain.com/2019-in-review/\">set them in 2019</a>, and then <a href=\"https://lethain.com/2022-in-review/\">revised them in 2022</a>.\nI’ve come to believe that I should be revising these every year,\nbut also that it’s not that interesting to revise them every year.\nI’ll revise them again in a few years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing</h2>\n<p>I finished my fourth book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Engineering-Strategy-Thoughtful-Decisions/dp/B0FBRJY116\"><em>Crafting Engineering Strategy</em></a>,\nand wrote <a href=\"https://lethain.com/crafting-engineering-strategy/\">some notes on writing it</a>.\nI’m really excited for this book to be done, because I think it’s been a missing book\nin the industry, and I hope it will change how the industry thinks about “engineering strategy.”\nIn particular, I hope it’ll pull us away from the frequent gripe that “we have no engineering strategy!”\nYou <em>do</em> have an engineering strategy, it’s just not written down yet.</p>\n<p>As part of finishing this book, I’ve also recognized that\nif I write another book, it will be far into the future.\nAfter publishing four books in six years, I’m booked out,\nand I’m pretty sure I’ve tapped out my last decade’s path of\n<a href=\"https://lethain.com/advancing-the-industry-pt2/\">writing books to advance the industry</a>.\nI’ll definitely keep writing, but it’ll be posts focused on the stuff\nI’m concretely working on, without trying to map them into a larger book structure.</p>\n<p>(Last year I mentioned adding <a href=\"https://lethain.com/high-context-triad/\">The High-Context Triad</a> to a second\nedition of <em>Staff Engineer</em>, which I still plan to do, but I’m not quite sure when.\nProbably in a few years.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://lethain.com/stuff-learned-at-carta/\">left Carta in May</a> after two years there, and joined Imprint.\nImprint has just been a lot of fun for me. I’ve written a small number of real pull requests\nthat implement meaningful things.\nThat’s something I haven’t done since working at Uber,\nand aligns with my desire to be working in the details again.\nThere’s nothing more energizing to me than getting to solve real, concrete problems,\nand that’s exactly the sort of job Imprint has been for me.\nI just haven’t been spenting time on stuff like <a href=\"https://lethain.com/notion-agent/\">implementing internal workflow agents</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lethain.com/dependabot-auto-merge/\">automatically merging Dependabot pull requests</a> in a long time,\nand I missed it.</p>\n<p>It’s also, after some years spent on making teams more efficient,\nbeen an opportunity to really hire again, which I haven’t gotten to do\nsince my first couple years at Calm.\nIt’s <a href=\"https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/\">never easy working at a fast growing company</a>,\nbut you do learn a lot, and quite quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"family\">Family</h2>\n<p>My son entered kindergarten this year. I turned 40.\nMy wife is starting to explore the world of fractional software development,\nand she’s figuring out its rules.\nWe’ve had a fair amount of health issues in the immediate\nand extended family, but altogether everything is going well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"speaking\">Speaking</h2>\n<p>I didn’t do much public speaking, although I spoke on\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBPtGtMY8bE\">Book Overflow about Staff Engineer</a>,\nwhich was a fun discussion.</p>\n<p>I also spoke at several private events, and recorded practice runs on YouTube\nof <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJlrX4Z4QWs&t=968s&pp=0gcJCTwKAYcqIYzv\">Good engineering management is a fad</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q98TAMoiMI\">CTOs must earn the right to specialize</a>.\nThose are very similar talks, where I’ve been iterating on the core\nidea of how engineering managers need to adapt to the current era.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading\">Reading</h2>\n<p>In 2024, I read 27 profession-adjacent books. In 2023, I read 11.\nI’m not quite sure how many I read in 2022, because I put together a\n<a href=\"https://lethain.com/books-2022/\">2019-2022 professional reading recap</a>, but it was about\n50 over four years. This year I didn’t do much professional reading,\nmostly because I was too busy with the new job and polishing my most recent book.</p>\n<p>What I did read was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AI-Engineering-Building-Applications-Foundation/dp/1098166302\">AI Engineering</a></em> by Chip Huyen</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.recodingamerica.us/\">Recoding America</a></em> by Jennifer Pahlka</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Facilitating-Software-Architecture-Empowering-Architectural-ebook/dp/B0DMHGWCPN/\">Facilitating Software Architecture</a></em> by Andrew Harmel-Law</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Turning-Flywheel-Monograph-Accompany-Great/dp/0062933795\">Turning the Flywheel</a></em> by Jim Collins</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s interesting to note the drop in volume, but I feel fine about it.\nI don’t read to hit a goal, I read to learn or understand a particular problem,\nand found myself mostly working on topics that didn’t align well with that\napproach this year.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’ve written something about your year, send it my way!</p>",

          "description": "<p>One of the recurring themes of software development is patching security issues.\nMost repository hosting services have fairly good issue reporting at this point, but many\norganizations still struggle to apply those fixes in a timely fashion.\nThis past week we were discussing how to reduce the overhead of this process,\nand I was curious: can you just auto-merge <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide\">Github Dependabot pull-requests</a>?</p>\n<p>It turns out, [the answer is yes], and it works pretty well.\nYou get control over which types of updates (patches, minor updates, major updates, etc) you want\nto auto-merge, and it will also respect your automated checks.\nIf you have great CI/CD that runs blocking linting, typing and tests, then this works\nparticularly well.\nIf you don’t, then, well, this will be an effective mechanism\nto get you to having good linting, typing, and tests afer traversing a small ocean of tears.</p>\n<p>I got this running for about a dozen repositories at work over the past few days,\nbut I’ll show an example of setting up the same mechanism for my blog.</p>\n<p>First, add a <code>.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml</code> file to your repository\nthat looks like this:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># Automatically approve and merge Dependabot PRs for minor and patch updates\nname: Dependabot auto-merge\non: pull_request\npermissions:\ncontents: write\npull-requests: write\njobs:\ndependabot:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nif: github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]' && github.repository == 'lethain/irrational_hugo'\nsteps:\n- name: Dependabot metadata\nid: metadata\nuses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v2\nwith:\ngithub-token: \"${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\"\n- name: Approve Dependabot PR\nrun: gh pr review --approve \"$PR_URL\"\nenv:\nPR_URL: ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}\nGH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n- name: Enable auto-merge for Dependabot PRs\nif: steps.metadata.outputs.update-type == 'version-update:semver-patch' || steps.metadata.outputs.update-type == 'version-update:semver-minor'\nrun: gh pr merge --auto --squash \"$PR_URL\"\nenv:\nPR_URL: ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}\nGH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n</code></pre><p>Then go to your repository settings (something like\n<code>https://github.com/lethain/irrational_hugo/settings</code>), and enable auto-merging\nfor your repository. This still respects all required branch rules, like required test passes\nor approvals, etc.</p>\n<div class=\"ba b--light-gray\">\n<p><img src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2025/dep-automerge.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Then make sure you have appropriate status checks for whatever\nlinting, typing and tests you have in your repository.</p>\n<div class=\"ba b--light-gray\">\n<p><img src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2025/dep-status-checks.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Then enable Dependabot (something like <code>https://github.com/lethain/irrational_hugo/settings/security_analysis</code>).\nEven the default settings are just find.</p>\n<div class=\"ba b--light-gray\">\n<p><img src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2025/dep-enable-prs.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Then you’re done. The PRs from dependabot will automatically merge going forward.\nThere are lots of nuances here–I already found one issues that automatically merged\ndespite an issue because of a missing test–but ultimately I think that’s valuable pressure\nto improve the testing quality, rather than a reason to avoid, or backtrack, on the approach.</p>",

          "title": "Parallel Compression Revamp: Dramatically Reduced CPU Overhead",
          "description": "<p>The upcoming RocksDB 10.7 release includes a major revamp of parallel compression that <strong>dramatically reduces the feature’s CPU overhead by up to 65%</strong> while maintaining or improving throughput for compression-heavy workloads. We expect this to broaden the set of workloads that could benefit from parallel compression, especially for <strong>bulk SST generation and remote compaction use cases</strong> that are less sensitive to CPU responsiveness.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>Parallel compression in RocksDB (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">CompressionOptions::parallel_threads > 1</code>) allows multiple threads to compress different blocks simultaneously during SST file generation, which can significantly improve compaction throughput for workloads where compression is a bottleneck. However, the original implementation had substantial CPU overhead that often outweighed the benefits, limiting its practical adoption.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-new-a-complete-reimplementation\">What’s New: A Complete Reimplementation</h2>\n\n<p>The parallel compression framework has been completely rewritten from the ground up in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/13910\">pull request #13910</a> to address the core inefficiencies:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ring-buffer-architecture\">Ring Buffer Architecture</h3>\n<p>Instead of separate compression and write queues with complex thread coordination, the new implementation uses a ring buffer of blocks-in-progress that enables efficient work distribution across threads. This bounds working memory while enabling high throughput with minimal cross-thread synchronization.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/parallel-compression/ring-buffer-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Ring Buffer Architecture\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"work-stealing-design\">Work-Stealing Design</h3>\n<p>Previously, the calling thread could only generate uncompressed blocks, dedicated compression threads could only compress, and a writer thread could only write the SST file to storage. Now, all threads can participate in compression work in a quasi-work-stealing manner, dramatically reducing the need for threads to block waiting for work. While only one thread (the calling thread or “emit thread”) can generate uncompressed SST blocks in the new implementation, feeding compression work to other threads and itself, all other threads are compatible with writing compressed blocks to storage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"auto-scaling-thread-management\">Auto-Scaling Thread Management</h3>\n<p>The ring buffer enables another key feature: auto-scaling of active threads based on ring buffer utilization. The framework intelligently wakes up idle worker threads only when there’s sufficient work to justify the overhead, achieving near-maximum throughput while minimizing CPU waste from unnecessary thread wake-ups.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lock-free-synchronization\">Lock-Free Synchronization</h3>\n<p>The entire framework is now lock-free (and wait-free as long as compatible work units are available for each thread), based primarily on atomic operations. To cleanly pack and leverage many data fields into a single atomic value, I’ve developed a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">BitFields</code> utility API. This is proving useful for cleaning up the HyperClockCache implementation as well, and will be the topic of a later blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Semaphores are used for lock-free management of idle threads (assuming a lock-free semaphore implementation, which is likely the case with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ROCKSDB_USE_STD_SEMAPHORES</code> but that is untrustworthy; see below).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"performance-improvements\">Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves. Here’s a comparison using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">db_bench</code> fillseq benchmarks with various compression configurations:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zstd-compression-default-level\">ZSTD Compression (Default Level)</h3>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“throughput” = how quickly a given CPU-bound flush or compaction can complete</li>\n  <li>“CPU increase” = total CPU usage in amount of time that each core was used</li>\n  <li>“PT” = parallel_threads setting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>PT=3: ~38% throughput increase for ~73% CPU increase</li>\n  <li>PT=6: No throughput increase for ~70% CPU increase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>PT=3: ~58% throughput increase for ~25% CPU increase</li>\n  <li>PT=6: ~58% throughput increase for ~28% CPU increase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"high-compression-scenarios\">High Compression Scenarios</h3>\n<p>For ZSTD compression level 8, the improvements are even more dramatic:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>PT=4: 2.6x throughput increase for 139% CPU increase</li>\n  <li>PT=8: 3.6x throughput increase for 135% CPU increase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>PT=4: 2.8x throughput increase for 114% CPU increase</li>\n  <li>PT=8: 3.7x throughput increase for 116% CPU increase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"compression-algorithm-optimizations\">Compression Algorithm Optimizations</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside the parallel compression revamp, some optimizations have gone into the underlying compression implementations/integrations. Most notably, <strong>LZ4HC received dramatic performance improvements</strong> through better reuse of internal data structures between compression calls (detailed in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/13805\">pull request #13805</a>). A small regression in LZ4 performance from that change was fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/14017\">pull request #14017</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While <strong>ZSTD remains the gold standard</strong> for medium-to-high compression ratios in RocksDB, these LZ4HC optimizations make it an increasingly attractive option for read-heavy workloads where LZ4’s faster decompression can provide overall performance benefits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"production-ready\">Production Ready</h2>\n\n<p>With these efficiency improvements, parallel compression is now considered <strong>production-ready</strong>. The feature has been thoroughly tested in both unit tests and stress testing, including validation on high-load scenarios with hundreds of concurrent compression jobs and thousands of threads.</p>\n\n<p>Some notes on current limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Parallel compression is currently incompatible with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">UserDefinedIndex</code> and with the deprecated <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decouple_partitioned_filters=false</code> setting</li>\n  <li>Maximum performance is available with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-DROCKSDB_USE_STD_SEMAPHORES</code> at compile time, though this is not currently recommended due to reported bugs in some implementations of C++20 semaphores</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"configuration-recommendations\">Configuration Recommendations</h2>\n\n<p>The dramatically reduced CPU overhead means parallel compression is now viable for a broader range of workloads, particularly those using higher compression levels or compression-heavy scenarios like time-series data. However, simply enabling parallel compression could result in more <em>spiky</em> CPU loads for hosts serving live DB data. <strong>Parallel compression might be most useful for bulk SST file generation and/or remote compaction workloads</strong> because they are less sensitive to CPU responsiveness. In these scenarios there is little danger in setting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">parallel_threads=8</code> even with the possibility of over-subscribing CPU cores, though the potentially safer “sweet spot” is typically around <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">parallel_threads=3</code>, depending on compression level, etc.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"limitations-and-future\">Limitations and Future</h2>\n\n<p>Although this offers a great improvement in the implementation of an existing option, we recognize that this setup is suboptimal in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>There is no work sharing / thread pooling for these SST compression/writer threads among compactions in the same process, so not well able to fit the workload to available CPU cores and not able to use other SST file compression work to avoid a worker thread going to sleep.</li>\n  <li>We are not (yet) using a framework that would allow micro-work sharing with things other than SST generation on a set of threads. That would be a good direction for effective sharing of CPU resources without spikes in usage, but might incur intolerable CPU overhead in managing work. With this “hand optimized” and specialized framework, we can at least evaluate such future endeavors against a perhaps ideal framework in terms of parallelizing with minimal overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try It Out</h2>\n\n<p>Parallel compression revamp will be available in RocksDB 10.7. As always, we recommend testing in your specific environment to determine the optimal configuration for your workload.</p>",

Treating all these operations the same makes it difficult for file system implementers to optimize performance, prioritize latency-sensitive IOs, and diagnose bottlenecks. To solve that, RocksDB internally tags every IO operation with its activity type using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IOActivity</code> enum.

A large share of our users also visualize their data via Grafana dashboards using Amazon Athena or Google BigQuery data sources (see our <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/13/how-to-visualize-vehicle-can-bus-data-with-the-amazon-athena-data-source-for-grafana/\">previous blog post</a> for details).</p>\n<p>In this blog, we show how <a href=\"/docs/grafana-cloud/machine-learning/assistant/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt\">Grafana Assistant</a> can be used to easily unleash the power of AI for data analysis and dashboard visualization—directly within Grafana!</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-grafana-assistant-for-can-data-analyses\">Why use Grafana Assistant for CAN data analyses?</h2>\n<p>Our users face a challenge: They can collect tons of CAN/LIN data using the CANedge, but they have to then explore or visualize data across several devices, thousands of log files, and months (or even years) of data.</p>\n<p>Most of our users are engineers, but they’re not data scientists. And even if they are, statistical data analysis/visualization can be extremely time consuming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-not-use-chatgpt\">Why not use ChatGPT?</h3>\n<p>One solution to this challenge is to use ChatGPT to help analyze the data, which we wrote about in a <a href=\"https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/chatgpt-can-bus-data-time-series-code-interpreter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2023 article</a>. However, ChatGPT has some practical limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limited to manually uploading small files (e.g. 100 MB CSV)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysis results are not easy to share</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Outputs are “static” (e.g., Python-generated plots)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"key-features-of-grafana-assistant\">Key features of Grafana Assistant </h3>\n<figure\nclass=\"figure-wrapper figure-wrapper__lightbox w-100p \"\nstyle=\"max-width: none;\"\nitemprop=\"associatedMedia\"\nitemscope=\"\"\nitemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\n><a\nclass=\"lightbox-link\"\nhref=\"https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1022730/800x600/75de30d1ec/can-data-architecture.png/m/\"\nitemprop=\"contentUrl\"\n><div class=\"img-wrapper w-100p h-auto\"><img\nclass=\"lazyload \"\nsrc=\"https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1022730/800x600/75de30d1ec/can-data-architecture.png/m/\"alt=\"Architectural diagram showing data going from heavy machinery to Google Cloud to Grafana Cloud and back\"/>\n</div></a></figure>\n<p>In practice, our end users typically upload gigabytes (or terabytes) of data to their own AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure cloud servers using our devices. Here, the data is auto-processed into Parquet data lakes, which can be queried via <a href=\"/blog/2025/06/18/visualize-google-cloud-bigquery-data-in-grafana-the-latest-updates-key-features-and-more/\">Grafana’s Athena/BigQuery data sources</a>. In other words, the complete data lake is easily accessible within Grafana. </p>\n<p>With the new assistant, Grafana Cloud now enables seamless LLM access to existing data sources that are already in place. This introduces multiple powerful features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Zero set up:</strong> If you have already deployed a Grafana integration, you can start prompting your data immediately—no set up required.</li>\n<li><strong>Analyze terabytes of data:</strong> Unlike ChatGPT, you don’t have to limit your analysis to 100 MB of data. The assistant can query your entire data lake out-the-box.</li>\n<li><strong>Data exploration:</strong> Simply chat your way to powerful data insights and through complex diagnostic analyses—no query language or coding knowledge required.</li>\n<li><strong>Dashboard creation:</strong> The assistant can create fully customized Grafana dashboards in seconds based on high level prompts, drastically reducing time spent.</li>\n<li><strong>Retain and share insights:</strong> Any data insights can be easily summarized into Grafana dashboards, enabling you to navigate the data temporally and share it with your team.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s basically Cursor/Windsurf for your dashboards and data lake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-start-analyzing-can-data-with-grafana-assistant\">How to start analyzing CAN data with Grafana Assistant </h2>\n<figure\nclass=\"figure-wrapper figure-wrapper__lightbox w-100p \"\nstyle=\"max-width: none;\"\nitemprop=\"associatedMedia\"\nitemscope=\"\"\nitemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\n><a\nclass=\"lightbox-link\"\nhref=\"https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1022730/1920x1023/88223b6f97/can-timeseries.png/m/\"\nitemprop=\"contentUrl\"\n><div class=\"img-wrapper w-100p h-auto\"><img\nclass=\"lazyload \"\nsrc=\"https://a-us.storyblok.com/f/1022730/1920x1023/88223b6f97/can-timeseries.png/m/\"alt=\"Grafana dashboard showing CAN timeseries data\"/>\n</div></a></figure>\n<p>If you have already connected your data source in Grafana Cloud, no further set up is necessary.</p>\n<p>To start chatting with the assistant, you can open the chat window via the left-menu Assistant tab. Alternatively, you can open the chat panel within a dashboard via the sparkle icon in the upper right corner.</p>\n<p>However, to get the best experience, we recommend following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use a dashboard template:</strong> At CSS we provide various dashboard templates customized for our end users, which include relevant <a href=\"/docs/grafana/latest/visualizations/dashboards/variables/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt\">Grafana variable</a> dropdowns. Using templates as the basis for LLM-based dashboard development is highly recommended as it allows dashboard users to subsequently interact with the generated dashboards (e.g. switching between different devices)</li>\n<li><strong>Select data source as context:</strong> Make sure to select the relevant data source in the Grafana Assistant chat window to explicitly tell it what data to work with.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a system prompt:</strong> In our documentation we provide a “system prompt” that our users can add as a “rule” within the Grafana Assistant settings. This provides context about the data lake structure, query syntax and more—and significantly improves the results. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"example-use-cases\">Example use cases</h3>\n<p>To showcase how Grafana Assistant can help with data analyses, we’ll use our <a href=\"https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/ev-data-pack-electric-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public data pack</a>, which consists of 1GB of data from a Kia EV6 electric vehicle. Below we highlight example use cases for the LLM:</p>\n<h4 id=\"example-1-see-what-data-is-available\">Example 1: See what data is available</h4>\n<p>First, we use the LLM to get an overview of our data lake.</p>\n<p>This is a useful starting point for exploring a CAN bus data lake as you do not necessarily have a clear overview of what devices, CAN messages, and CAN signals are available. Further, constructing the SQL queries to extract this information is quite complex.</p>\n<div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__mini\"><div class=\"lang-toolbar__mini\">\n<span class=\"code-clipboard\">\n<button x-data=\"app_code_snippet()\" x-init=\"init()\" @click=\"copy()\">\n<img class=\"code-clipboard__icon\" src=\"/media/images/icons/icon-copy-small-2.svg\" alt=\"Copy code to clipboard\" width=\"14\" height=\"13\">\n<span>Copy</span>\n</button>\n</span>\n</div><div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__border\">\n<pre data-expanded=\"false\"><code class=\"language-none\">Prompt:\nMy data source contains data from a Kia EV6 electric car, recorded with a CANedge CAN bus data logger with device ID 2A896980. The data includes battery data from the EV and GPS/IMU data from a sensor module. I want to know the following:\n1: What tables and columns are available for this device?\n2: What time period does the data span?</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Grafana Assistant starts analyzing the data via multiple queries, summarizing the results in a tabular form, and in the chat. Notice how the LLM iterates through multiple queries to understand the data structure. You can of course inspect what queries are used to generate each result, ensuring full transparency. The summary provides us with a good starting point for further investigation.</p>\n<figure\nclass=\"responsive-video p-0 m-0\"\nx-data=\"{ vimeo_is_up: false, responded: false }\"\nx-init=\"fetch(`https://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=https://vimeo.com/1145695358`)\n.then(response => {\nresponded = true;\nresponse && response.status === 200 ? vimeo_is_up = true : vimeo_is_up = false;\n})\n.catch(error => {\nresponded = true;\n})\"\n>\n<div class=\"minh-428\">\n<template x-if=\"vimeo_is_up\">\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1145695358?transparent=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"vimeo video\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</template>\n<template x-if=\"responded && !vimeo_is_up\">\n<p class=\"bg-gray-17 p-1\">There’s supposed to be a video here, but for some reason there isn’t.

We can also prompt the LLM to create a panel that displays speed over time within our dashboard, which Grafana does successfully as shown below.</p>\n<div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__mini\"><div class=\"lang-toolbar__mini\">\n<span class=\"code-clipboard\">\n<button x-data=\"app_code_snippet()\" x-init=\"init()\" @click=\"copy()\">\n<img class=\"code-clipboard__icon\" src=\"/media/images/icons/icon-copy-small-2.svg\" alt=\"Copy code to clipboard\" width=\"14\" height=\"13\">\n<span>Copy</span>\n</button>\n</span>\n</div><div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__border\">\n<pre data-expanded=\"false\"><code class=\"language-none\">Prompt:\nWhat is the average speed from the CAN2_GnssSpeed message in July 2023?

In this example we try a minimal-effort prompt—leaving a lot up to the imagination of the LLM.</p>\n<p>The result is a functional 12-panel dashboard where all SQL queries are as expected (i.e., as per our system prompt guidance). Notice in particular that the LLM proactively identifies available (and relevant) messages/signals. Pretty cool! It’s worth reflecting on how commoditized LLMs + tools have already become. If this was 2022 we’d have been blown away.</p>\n<p>However, the dashboard we get is highly inconsistent between re-runs of the same prompt. This is of course to be expected given the open-ended nature of our request. In our view, there’s not much practical value to providing prompts that are this high level if the goal is to create real Grafana dashboards.</p>\n<div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__mini\"><div class=\"lang-toolbar__mini\">\n<span class=\"code-clipboard\">\n<button x-data=\"app_code_snippet()\" x-init=\"init()\" @click=\"copy()\">\n<img class=\"code-clipboard__icon\" src=\"/media/images/icons/icon-copy-small-2.svg\" alt=\"Copy code to clipboard\" width=\"14\" height=\"13\">\n<span>Copy</span>\n</button>\n</span>\n</div><div class=\"code-snippet code-snippet__border\">\n<pre data-expanded=\"false\"><code class=\"language-none\">Prompt:\nMy data source contains data from a Kia EV6 electric car, recorded with a CANedge CAN bus data logger with device ID 2A896980.

You can find the full detailed prompt <a href=\"https://canlogger1000.csselectronics.com/files/guides/grafana-assistant-intro/grafana-assistant-detailed-dashboard-prompt.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the result looks as intended. And more importantly, when we run this 10x (in new conversations each time), we get a 90%+ consistent dashboard each time.</p>\n<p>You might argue that writing a prompt like this is also time consuming, but in our experience it is still five to 10 times faster than if we were to construct this dashboard from scratch. For example, notice that many of our message/signal names are approximate, leaving Grafana Assistant to figure out what the exact table and column names are. Further, some of the panels involve semi-complex queries (e.g., the consumed State of Charge and the delta distance traveled), which would require significant SQL expertise to create.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the prompt specifies no SQL syntax, which is important as 99%+ of our end users have zero SQL experience.</p>\n<p>Check out the generated dashboard in our <a href=\"https://grafana.csselectronics.stellarhosted.com/d/grafana-assistant-ev6-bigquery/grafana-assistant-ev6-bigquery?orgId=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public playground</a>.</p>\n<figure\nclass=\"responsive-video p-0 m-0\"\nx-data=\"{ vimeo_is_up: false, responded: false }\"\nx-init=\"fetch(`https://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=https://vimeo.com/1145695326`)\n.then(response => {\nresponded = true;\nresponse && response.status === 200 ? vimeo_is_up = true : vimeo_is_up = false;\n})\n.catch(error => {\nresponded = true;\n})\"\n>\n<div class=\"minh-428\">\n<template x-if=\"vimeo_is_up\">\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1145695326?transparent=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"vimeo video\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</template>\n<template x-if=\"responded && !vimeo_is_up\">\n<p class=\"bg-gray-17 p-1\">There’s supposed to be a video here, but for some reason there isn’t.

Here are our overarching thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>1: Excellent concept.</strong> For users that have already hooked up Grafana to their data, it is extremely simple to start working with the data through the LLM. This ease-of-access is a critical advantage—and the Grafana Assistant UI is great.</p>\n<p><strong>2: A drunk genius.</strong> Grafana Assistant can give you that “magical experience” where you sit back and watch it produce an entire Grafana dashboard in one shot according to your specifications. However, in some cases it will produce invalid queries, get stuck or hallucinate—just like all LLMs. Make sure to always review the output.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Visualization vs. analysis.</strong> The LLM is able to modify dashboards and execute SQL queries, making it an excellent tool for data visualization and light exploration. However, it is not able to run scripts (in contrast to ChatGPT, for example), making it less suitable for highly complex, multi-step data analysis—at least for now. Such functionality could be a powerful future mode/variation of the assistant.</p>\n<p><strong>4: Huge potential.</strong> While the current version has limitations in terms of performance and data source support, we are confident that Grafana Assistant will become an extremely handy tool for data visualization and exploration. In just our one month of testing, Grafana added a ton of improvements to the LLM, so we are excited to see how this tool develops!</p>\n<p>To learn more and see additional showcases, check out our <a href=\"https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/grafana-assistant-can-bus-data-ai-llm-dashboards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full Grafana Assistant article</a>!</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"/products/cloud/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt\">Grafana Cloud</a></em> <em>is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more.

The transcript below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"first-tinkers-from-zx-spectrums-to-5000-lb-garage-surprises\">First tinkers: from ZX Spectrums to 5,000-lb garage surprises</h2>\n<p><strong>Mat Ryer:</strong> My dad was into computers really early, so we had a ZX Spectrum at home. That’s where I learned BASIC first. I loved it — you could make things happen in this little universe. I’ve been hooked ever since. I kind of miss when tech used to be rubbish; now everything’s shiny and just works.</p>\n<p><strong>Brad Fitzpatrick:</strong> We had a bootleg Apple II my dad made from stolen parts and a stolen ROM. He taught me to program when I was like five or six, and I kind of haven’t stopped since.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew McCalip:</strong>  I sort of shocked my parents when I was 14 — I brought home this old CNC machine, a 5,000-pound monstrosity, and parked it in the garage. That was the start of my hardware career… and there’s basically always been a CNC around since.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivana Huckova:</strong> I joined Grafana as a frontend engineer, so naturally my onboarding project was a little IoT monitoring solution. My manager Dan mailed me an ESP32 board in an envelope, with all the sensors. That really sparked everything — since then I’ve built monitoring for my sourdough starter, my avocado plant, my standing desk, and I once tried to build a dog happiness monitoring solution. That one failed, so it’s on the list for version two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"useful-3d-printing-beyond-trinkets\">Useful 3D printing: beyond trinkets</h2>\n<p><strong>Tom Wilkie:</strong> I saw on your profile you’ve got a 3D printer. What have you actually been using it for?</p>\n<p><strong>Brad:</strong> My kids wanted one for Christmas, then lost interest after about a day… so now I have a 3D printer. At this point, half our house is plastic. I’ve printed baby-proofing corner guards, a Wi-Fi mount. We had this bathtub with a tiny one-inch gap at the back where everything fell and you couldn’t reach it, so I printed a shelf that clicks together and fills it. Now nothing falls down there.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> You’re the first person I’ve asked who didn’t just say ‘I printed parts for more printers.’</p>\n<p><strong>Brad:</strong> Oh no, I love CAD. Making useful stuff is the fun part.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom (to Andrew):</strong> But you’ve got a <em>real</em> 3D printer… or rather a CNC, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, a 17,000-pound Haas CNC. You can actually pay people to move something that big on 18-wheelers. I think of it as a metal compiler — metal goes in, parts come out. It’s super-satisfying.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iot-wins-and-one-smoky-fail\">IoT wins (and one smoky fail)</h2>\n<p><strong>Ivana</strong>: With my plant monitoring, I learned more than from any blog post — how much water they need, how much sun, what the light looks like over the day. I was terrible at taking care of plants, but after wiring all this up I actually became good at it. One of my biggest failed projects was candle monitoring. I wanted to watch the PM particles when you blow a candle out, and I also wanted to know if I’d left a candle burning after leaving the apartment. The idea was that if it was still on, I could remotely shut it down. So I built a system where a wooden lid would drop on the candle. During testing, the lid… caught fire. I did at least learn that you shouldn’t mess with fire when you’re outside your apartment.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong>: My laser cutter is in the garage for exactly that reason — not in my office. Also, it smells terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivana</strong>: And as for dog happiness v1 — my dog is very hairy. Double-coated, very long hair. I tried using a heart rate monitor on him, but if you just strap a sensor onto a lot of fur, it’s not very reliable. I also put a little camera on him, and every time his heart rate went up, it took a photo. The results were mostly hair, feet, and pavement. So I need a better heart rate sensor, or a different camera placement. I’m not abandoning the idea — version 2 is definitely on the list for a future Grafana hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I have five 3D printers in my office. I dread monitoring the air in there. I am made of microplastics now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ocean-robot-ballast-barnacles-and-redundancy\">The ocean robot: ballast, barnacles, and “redundancy”</h2>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I want to ask about your ocean-going drone ship. How are you going to handle terrible weather? What happens when it inevitably capsizes?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Good question. If you’re not careful, things in the ocean don’t stay upright. So we gave the boat a really deep keel with a big lead ballast. If it flips over, the idea is it self-rights. We actually wrote a whole Python script to model the hydrodynamics and buoyancy, then tested it in water a few times — it works great.</p>\n<p><strong>Brad:</strong> Did you model the keel breaking?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> We have two models: the strong keel and the fast keel. Priority one, since we’re mechanical people more than software people, was ‘Make sure it doesn’t flip over.’ Priority two was ‘turn it off and back on again.’</p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Do you have a secondary backup control system?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> No. No backup. There was a big philosophical debate about redundancy. Is anything truly redundant? In the end we decided the easiest redundancy is: make a second boat. So we test, test, test, and when we’re happy, we ship it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> And when it fails in the ocean, how do you get to it to reboot it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> We don’t. We’ll tell Twitter, ‘It was last seen at this latitude/longitude. If anybody finds it, please tow it back to Los Angeles.’ It’ll just be out there floating around.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> Does it have a name? And why is it not Boaty McBoatface?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Boaty McBoatface was a strong contender, but it’s kind of taken. It’s called Bob, after the Bobiverse books — sci-fi about a sentient spacecraft that makes copies of itself and explores the universe. It’s poetic, and also a pun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parting-words\">Parting words</h2>\n<p>It wouldn’t be Big Tent without a nod to history.</p>\n<p><strong>Brad:</strong> LiveJournal was like Twitter in 1998. The first client was a Windows app with a single input bar across the bottom of your screen. You typed, hit Enter, and it posted. No paragraphs — hitting Enter just posted it. Somehow it ended up with millions of users. In the opening scene of that Facebook movie, the actor playing Zuckerberg is actually on LiveJournal. That’s my little movie cameo, via software.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I don’t think anything I’ve written has ever been in a movie.</p>\n<p><strong>Mat:</strong> What a flex.</p>\n<p><em>“Grafana’s Big Tent” podcast wants to hear from you.

          "title": "Reducing experiment duration with predicted control variates",
          "description": "<p>I<em>n 2021, we published a blog post titled “<a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/codeascraft/increasing-experimentation-accuracy-and-speed-by-using-control-variates\">Increasing experimentation accuracy and speed by using control variates</a>,” describing how we reduce the variance of metrics using CUPED in our experimentation platform. This is a follow-up on how CUPED has evolved at Etsy since then. Spoiler – It’s changed a lot, decreasing our average experiment duration by 3 days!</em></p>\n<p>Etsy’s mission is to Keep Commerce Human. To achieve this, we need to understand the impact each change to our platform has on our buyers' and sellers' experience. Whether that involves changing the color of the “Buy Now” button on the Etsy app or updating elements of how our algorithms rank search results, we leverage large-scale online experimentation to iterate on and improve the things we build.</p>\n<p>However, running an experiment can be a long process. From design and setup to running the experiment and analyzing results, the entire experimentation process can take weeks to months. Experiments must run long enough to collect sufficient data for the results to be statistically significant – ensuring we can confidently attribute observed changes to the treatment, rather than random chance. On the other hand, being able to learn from an experiment quickly is a crucial step in the product development lifecycle, enabling faster improvements to Etsy. Fortunately, there are tools to reduce experiment runtime. <a href=\"https://exp-platform.com/Documents/2013-02-CUPED-ImprovingSensitivityOfControlledExperiments.pdf\">CUPED</a> is one of them! Variance reduction techniques like CUPED can help reduce the time to run an experiment, shortening the overall experimentation lifecycle and time to learning, as visualized below.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Experimentation Lifecycle\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/508bdd/7485804299/inv_fullxfull.7485804299_5dhtrbg7.jpg?version=0\" title=\"Experimentation Lifecycle\" />\n</figure>\n<h2>A recap of CUPED</h2>\n<p>CUPED is a variance reduction technique that estimates experiment outcomes with greater speed and accuracy compared to a direct comparison between control and treatment groups. In 2021, Etsy <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/codeascraft/increasing-experimentation-accuracy-and-speed-by-using-control-variates\">implemented CUPED</a> (Controlled-Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) for key metrics like Conversion Rate (the percentage of visitors that make a purchase). </p>\n<p>CUPED leverages historical visitor data collected before the experiment begins — for example, the number of purchases in the week prior to the experiment – to explain some natural variation in the outcome metric. The pre-experiment factors are used as covariates in a linear regression model to remove some of the “noise” that is not attributable to the treatment. By accounting for this variation, CUPED reduces the variance of the treatment effect estimator, increasing statistical power and improving sensitivity without introducing bias.</p>\n<p>The CUPED correction can be conceptualized as:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPED formula\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/c3af38/7484132339/inv_fullxfull.7484132339_n7wzrht2.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPED formula\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The CUPED-adjusted metric will have a smaller variance than the original metric, as visualized below, providing more precise estimates of a mean or treatment effect.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPED variance chart\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/c804c6/7436156294/inv_fullxfull.7436156294_lknh7nir.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPED variance chart\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Sample size, power, and variance are all related. Holding everything else unchanged, the smaller the variance of a metric, the smaller the sample size required to reach a desired power. Since we can reduce the variance of our metric by applying CUPED, we can achieve the same amount of power with a smaller sample size. In practice, a smaller sample size corresponds to a shorter experiment duration. </p>\n<p>Etsy’s initial <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/codeascraft/increasing-experimentation-accuracy-and-speed-by-using-control-variates\">implementation of CUPED</a> yielded an average variance reduction of 7% across all experiments, with some experiments achieving up to 30% variance reduction. Experiments that used CUPED-adjusted metrics in decision-making yielded a decision about 1 day earlier, on average. However, we’re always iterating to improve our buyers’ and sellers’ experience on Etsy, and we knew we could do even better. Enter: CUPAC.</p>\n<h2>Leveling up further with CUPAC</h2>\n<p>During our research and implementation of CUPED in 2020, scientists at DoorDash published a <a href=\"https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/improving-experimental-power-through-control-using-predictions-as-covariate-cupac/\">blog post</a> describing a novel statistical method, building on CUPED, called Control Using Predictions as Covariate, or “CUPAC.” </p>\n<p>When performing CUPAC, the pre-experiment data is first input into a non-linear machine learning model that captures more complex relationships than a linear model. The non-linear model is trained to predict the outcome metric of interest – for example, if an experiment is measuring the observed Conversion Rate, the model would predict Conversion Rate. The prediction more effectively captures the impact of pre-experiment behaviors on our experimental outcomes than the raw pre-experiment data because it captures complex relationships in the data that linear regression alone cannot. The prediction is then used as an “ML-based covariate” in a linear regression to perform the CUPED correction: </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPAC formula\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/635c10/7484133503/inv_fullxfull.7484133503_juhuwigr.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPAC formula\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The CUPAC-adjusted outcome has an even smaller variance than the CUPED-adjusted outcome, as visualized below.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPAC variance chart\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/652fa0/7484077983/inv_fullxfull.7484077983_7p7csls3.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPAC variance chart\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Empirically, our CUPAC-adjusted metrics showed even lower variance than CUPED. Our initial prototype demonstrated that CUPAC produced an adjusted metric with an additional 10% smaller variance when compared to our original CUPED estimator. Despite the added complexity, these results justified incorporating CUPAC into our experimentation pipeline. We hypothesized it would cut average experiment duration by an additional day, enabling teams to run more experiments and ship changes to Etsy faster.</p>\n<h2>Training and implementation</h2>\n<p>The first step was to train the CUPAC models to predict the ML-based covariate. We identified over 100 pre-experiment features, increasing from 3 features in CUPED, to capture more behavior prior to the experiment. Using these features, we iteratively trained and tuned the models in Vertex AI. Hyperparameters were optimized on a validation dataset to maximize the median correlation between the model’s predictions and the observed in-experiment metrics across experiments.</p>\n<p>Initially we trained <a href=\"https://xgboost.ai/\">XGBoost</a>, a popular <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests/intro-to-gbdt\">gradient boosted tree</a> model, but then found <a href=\"https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">LightGBM</a>, a similar non-linear, tree-based model, was better suited to predict the covariate. When testing the models at scale with billions of predictions, LightGBM demonstrated both rapid training and prediction times, along with strong validation results.</p>\n<p>Once the models were trained, our next challenge was to implement them at scale. Our experimentation pipeline runs batch jobs for hundreds of experiments each day. From our original implementation, we had an Airflow DAG (directed acyclic graph) to orchestrate the CUPED variance reduction pipeline, as visualized below:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPED pipeline\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/baa64c/7436088400/inv_fullxfull.7436088400_c1h413ot.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPED pipeline\" />\n</figure>\n<p>We evolved this pipeline to support CUPAC by adding a batch prediction step to produce the ML-based covariate.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"CUPAC pipeline\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/755784/7437734230/inv_fullxfull.7437734230_dc480y5e.jpg?version=0\" title=\"CUPAC pipeline\" />\n</figure>\n<p>In the above CUPAC pipeline, we perform the following steps: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculate pre-experiment features and in-experiment data using BigQuery SQL jobs.</li>\n<li>Predict ML-based covariates with our trained LightGBM models via parallel Dataflow jobs using the pre-experiment features.</li>\n<li>Perform variance reduction with a Spark job that fits a linear regression model between the ML-based covariates and in-experiment data, creating the CUPAC-adjusted metrics.</li>\n<li>Apply statistical t-tests using the CUPAC-adjusted metric to calculate the treatment effect, p-value, and power of the experiment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact: Shortening average experiment duration by 3 days</h2>\n<p>We measured success through variance reduction. Variance reduction is the percent change between the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variance of the metric <em>without</em> CUPAC, and</li>\n<li>Variance of the CUPAC-adjusted metric. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The original CUPED implementation showed 7% variance reduction, reducing overall experiment duration by almost 1 day, on average. After implementing CUPAC, we observed an average of 27% variance reduction, nearly <strong>4x as much variance reduction</strong>, when compared to CUPED, exceeding our early research estimates.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Impact chart\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/63d8c5/7437853008/inv_fullxfull.7437853008_6cpvb4kq.jpg?version=0\" title=\"Impact chart\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The additional variance reduction shortens our average experiment duration by almost 3 days. <strong>This means a 10-day experiment could conclude in only 7 days due to the ability to reach power on a smaller sample size with CUPAC</strong>. These marginal time savings allow many teams to run <strong>10 or more additional experiments each year</strong>. That translates to more opportunities to test and faster insights into how we can deliver the best experience for our community of millions of sellers and buyers. </p>\n<p>Notably, there was a substantial spread in variance reduction among different metrics and experiments, ranging from 2% to 77%. In the chart below, each blue bar displays the percent variance reduction for a sampled metric on an experiment. </p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Percent chart\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/9bc046/7485759507/inv_fullxfull.7485759507_eog6ydtb.jpg?version=0\" title=\"Percent chart\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The large range is expected because variance reduction can be influenced by several factors, such as metric definition, data accessibility, experimental design, and market characteristics. These factors impact how predictive the pre-experiment data is of the outcome metric, resulting in the degree of variance reduction. For example, two common experimentation metrics are Mean Visits and Purchase Rate. In the e-commerce setting, an individual's visit behavior will almost always be more stable over time than their purchasing behavior. This implies that pre-experiment data is more correlated with in-experiment data for a visit-related metric than for a purchase-related metric. Therefore, CUPAC is more effective at reducing variance in a metric like Mean Visits than in a metric like Purchase Rate.</p>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Aligned with Etsy’s culture of experimentation, we’ll continue to evolve our pipeline to be nimble and flexible based on the needs of the teams that use them. </p>\n<p>One challenge we face is that teams use metrics curated to specific parts of the Etsy experience – like search, recommendations, seller features, etc. – to make decisions on their experiment results. However, our CUPAC models take significant time to train and maintain for each metric, consequently limiting the number of CUPAC-adjusted metrics we can develop. While we continue to grow CUPAC use, we also encourage teams to continue to use CUPED, which is more scalable and has lower maintenance costs. To account for this, we plan to increase the flexibility of CUPED to more metrics by automatically collecting pre-experiment data based on the metric definition to reduce noise. In tandem with our work on CUPAC, this CUPED expansion will enable teams across Etsy to benefit from variance reduction across all their team-specific metrics, not just a select few.</p>\n<p>Despite the success of CUPED and CUPAC thus far, there remains a need to explore additional variance reduction techniques for the current metrics that leverage CUPAC. In 2024, we released research findings exploring a novel approach: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09027\">Variance reduction combining pre-experiment and in-experiment data</a>. As we look to generalize our variance reduction architecture, we expect that incorporating such techniques will continue to strengthen our experimentation platform and enable product teams to iterate more quickly.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it is important to recognize that applying variance reduction in practice can be a never-ending race to squeeze the most noise out of these estimators. In our experience, the craft lies in finding the sweet spot between variance reduction, implementation cost, and the impact on experimentation velocity. That intersection is context-dependent and what makes experimentation code as craft.</p>\n<p>We hope our experience inspires you to try out variance reduction techniques and determine which one is best suited to your needs!</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Thank you to Alexander Tank and Stephane Shao for their work on initial research and implementation of CUPAC.

The \"do\"-ing can be either <strong>prefetching</strong> (just download the HTML) or <strong>prerendering</strong> (load the page, including its static assets, and <em>render</em> it completely). The prerendering happens in a new browser process and page B is ready to be swapped with the current page A instantaneously when the user navigates to B.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While implementing full prerendering is likely to yield more impressive performance improvements, it is a bigger and riskier investment, mostly related to the side effects of executing the JavaScript on the target page B. Starting with prefetching is a good first step into exploring SRA.</p>\n<p>The benefits of using SRA over link prefetch will become evident further in the article but the topline highlights include: a simpler API to define <em>what</em> is prefetched (via a CSS selector rather than do-it-yourself bespoke JavaScript), convenient utilities to define <em>when</em>, as well as <em>where</em> (memory and HTTP cache) prefetching happens, and a built-in upgrade path to full on prerendering.</p>\n<h2>Implementing Speculation Rules</h2>\n<p>The Search team at Etsy recently ran an A/B experiment to use the Speculation Rules API to prefetch the listing page when hovering over organic listing cards on the desktop search page on Chromium browsers. To do this, we added a new <code><script type=\"speculationrules\"></code> tag to the search page with JSON that defines how we want the prefetching to work, like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><script type=\"speculationrules\">\n{\n  \"prefetch\": [{\n    \"where\": {\n        \"and\": [\n          {\n            \"href_matches\": \"/{*/}?listing/*\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"selector_matches\": \"[data-sr-prefetch='1']\"\n          }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"eagerness\": \"moderate\"\n  }]\n}\n</script></code></pre>\n<p>This instructs the browser to download the HTML for a <em>listing</em> page when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the user hovers over a link to a listing page for 200 milliseconds (defined by the “moderate” <code>eagerness</code> property), and   </li>\n<li>the link has a <code>data-sr-prefetch</code> attribute</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>data</code> attribute allows us to more precisely opt in pages that are eligible for prefetching. </p>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p>In terms of changes to the page’s code, the implementation of SRA was straightforward. As such, we spent most of our time testing that everything was working as expected and that our systems and analytics were not inadvertently affected. And we found some surprises along the way, related to all the little details modern web pages use (such as cookies, redirects, new tabs).</p>\n<p>Allow us to share a few lessons in prefetching...</p>\n<h3>Two ways to prefetch</h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, prefetching can happen one of two ways: <code><link rel=\"prefetch\"></code> or speculative prefetch (the one using SRA). So what sets them apart?</p>\n<p>They do work mostly the same, except that the speculative prefetch caches the page in both memory and the HTTP cache. The <code><link></code> only uses the HTTP cache and merely downloads the specified resource.</p>\n<p>This makes the SRA way of prefetching more advantageous than the <code><link></code> prefetch because of the memory cache.</p>\n<h3>Two speculative prefetches only</h3>\n<p>We also discovered the number of prefetched pages that are kept in memory is restricted to two. When you prefetch a third page, the first one is evicted from the memory cache. The HTTP cache still works as usual. So again, the SRA prefetching is preferable to the <code><link></code> prefetch due to the difference in caching we just described.</p>\n<p>It’s helpful while debugging to be aware of the eviction of the prefetched page from memory. But rest assured, the downloaded page is still cached locally.</p>\n<h3>Eagerness</h3>\n<p>While <code><link rel=\"prefetch\"></code> advises the browser to load a resource as soon as it sees the <code><link></code> in the DOM, the speculative prefetch is more nuanced, offering <em>eager</em>, <em>immediate</em>, <em>conservative</em> and <em>moderate</em> loading. We selected <em>moderate</em> eagerness, which prefetches after the user has hovered over a link for 200ms.</p>\n<p>Exploring our options we found that the <em>immediate</em> eagerness would trigger a significantly larger number of prefetches (since it executes immediately and prefetches <em>all</em> eligible pages), and we wanted to avoid creating new server requests for listing cards with a low likelihood of being clicked. However, the <em>immediate</em> eagerness setting could be worth considering if the cost of additional requests is very low. The <em>conservative</em> eagerness executes on pointer or touch down, providing a very small head start over normal browser behavior and therefore greatly reducing the potential benefits of prefetching. Conservative eagerness may only be suitable for a use case in which it is necessary to avoid unused prefetches altogether.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>eager</em> and <em>immediate</em> were synonyms in the initial SRA implementation, but that is changing. Keep an eye on <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/prerender-pages#eagerness\">the official docs</a> for updates.</p>\n<h3>Speculations and new browser tabs</h3>\n<p>Initially, SRA launched without the ability to prerender pages that open in new tabs, as Etsy listings do. This option was added later, but only for values <code>_blank</code> of the <code>target</code> attribute of the link elements, not named <code>target</code> attributes such as the ones that Etsy uses, for example <code><a href=\"/listing/123\" target=\"etsy.123456\"></code>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the target restriction doesn't apply to prefetching, so for SRA prefetching (unlike SRA prerendering) there's no problem, regardless of whether or how you specify a target at all. For developers who may be considering moving from prefetching to prerendering, this distinction is something to bear in mind. </p>\n<h3>5-minute rule</h3>\n<p>Because of the complex nature of listing pages, Etsy's HTML pages are non-cacheable. However, the speculative prefetch keeps the prefetched pages cached in memory for five minutes. This was a helpful learning, as there would be no point of using speculative prefetches at all if they expire immediately. After five minutes, the normal caching rules apply, set via HTTP headers such as <code>Max-age</code> or <code>Expires</code>.</p>\n<p>Given that only two pages are currently kept in memory cache and all others expire because they are non-cacheable, the benefits are greatly reduced when, for example, a person hovers over 3 links and eventually clicks the first one which leads to a page that's already expired from the prefetch memory (and HTTP!) cache.</p>\n<p>To aid with the two-page restriction, one strategy we devised is to make our pages cacheable for five minutes when we detect a prefetch request. Such requests are identifiable because the browser sends <code>Sec-Purpose: prefetch</code> HTTP header when prefetching. This helps preserve downloaded pages that would’ve otherwise expired from both memory and HTTP cache.</p>\n<h3>Video links and shadow DOM</h3>\n<p>Often, listings on Etsy include product videos, which start to play on the search results page when a user hovers their mouse over them. In these cases, prefetching doesn't work: the mouse hover is effectively \"swallowed,\" disappearing into the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM\">shadow DOM</a> of the browser's video player. One workaround is to overlay a <code>div</code> on top of the video for 200ms to let the hover register in the DOM. Then, after the 200ms has elapsed, remove the extra <code>div</code> to let the browser video controls (e.g., on right click) work as usual. You can find a demonstration of this technique <a href=\"https://www.phpied.com/files/sra/imagehover3.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cookies</h3>\n<p>If a page sets cookies, prefetching it will set those cookies as well (as demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.phpied.com/files/sra/test.html\">here</a>). This is something to be aware of, as the prefetch may end up being unused. This may confuse your application (and/or analytics) to thinking a page has been visited where in reality it was not.</p>\n<p>Again, you can use <code>Sec-Purpose: prefetch</code> HTTP header to detect prefetch requests and avoid setting the cookie as part of the prefetching process.</p>\n<h3>Redirects</h3>\n<p>If the link to the page being prefetched goes through a redirect, the actual page after the redirect is still being prefetched. Let’s say you have a sequence that looks like this:</p>\n<p>Link on Page A -> redirect -> Page B </p>\n<p>Here the browser follows the redirect during prefetching and still caches Page B. When the user then clicks the link on page A leading to Page B, the browser follows the usual process of going through the redirect. Normal HTTP cache rules still apply, meaning that if the redirect is cached, it won’t need to be requested again.</p>\n<p>So, even though redirects are a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/AvoidRedirects\">bad performance practice</a>, if you need to do them, they do not affect prefetching as long as you set appropriate caching headers.</p>\n<h3>Mutating hrefs</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the <code>href</code> attributes of <code><link></code> elements get modified by JavaScript on mouse hover. This does not play well with prefetching. Imagine you have:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><a href=\"link.html\">Follow me</a></code></pre>\n<p>… which changes on hover to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><a href=\"link.html?source=footer\">Follow me</a></code></pre>\n<p>When the user hovers over the link, the browser starts working on prefetching <code>link.html</code> but realizes that the link to that page is no longer in the DOM and abandons the process. So the page is not prefetched even if <code>?source=footer</code> doesn’t change the target page in any way other than reporting analytics. The browser has no way of knowing this and considers the two as separate pages.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the failed attempt at prefetching <code>link.html</code> counts in the “two speculations only” rule and evicts the older speculative load from the memory cache. For best results, avoid modifying links on hover.</p>\n<h3>Analytics and Event Logging</h3>\n<p>This is the elephant in the room. Many sites on the web today were built in a world where prefetching did not exist. So there is one big assumption: that a page load is always initiated by the user and the load can be counted as such – either server-side during page construction or client-side by JavaScript after the page is loaded (or, as it often happens, a combination of the two). With prefetching, this assumption is no longer true. A page constructed on the server-side and downloaded by the browser does not necessarily mean the page has been seen (and therefore its JavaScript has been executed). This can result in a number of miscalculations when it comes to analytics.</p>\n<p>Luckily, browser APIs such as the <code>Sec-Purpose</code> HTTP header and JavaScript APIs (<code>document.prerendering</code> and <code>prerenderingchange</code> event) allow us to tell prerender requests from user-generated ones, as well as when a prerendered page is \"activated\" (when the user actually sees a prefetched page). For prefetches, Performance Resource Timing’s <code>deliveryType</code> method of <code>navigational-prefetch</code> can be used for the purposes of analytics.</p>\n<p>We (and our analytics partners) found this to be the hardest part: ironing out the required analytics updates so that numbers remain true after implementing speculation rules. In our particular use case, we intentionally pursued a strategy of prefetching the destination page instead of prerendering it, meaning that no assets would be loaded and JavaScript would not execute on our prefetches. This gave us a relatively simple way to handle the accuracy of our analytics.</p>\n<p>A foundational piece of our analytics is event logging. For example, in the controller of the listing page we log a <code>view_listing</code> event that contains key information such as the listing ID, user ID, etc. This informs not only our site analytics, but also our search training pipeline, recently viewed listing data for users, and more. We ended up creating a system to cache the payload of all events within a request to avoid firing those events during prefetches. We were then able to move that event logging to the destination page’s JavaScript bundle, deferring them until after page “activation” and mitigating the impact of prefetching on our analytics.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We were thrilled with the performance results of the prefetching experiment. We saw a 20-24% improvement in many performance metrics we care about: <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/ttfb\">TTFB</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event\">DOMContentLoaded</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/fcp\">FCP</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lcp\">LCP</a>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 75th percentile time to first byte (TTFB) on the listing page improved by 23.6%   </li>\n<li>We saw similar improvements throughout the request: First Contentful Paint -20.7%, Largest Contentful Paint -21.1%, DOMContentLoaded -20.4%, and Page Load -10.6%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the cumulative distribution function below, we see the control of our experiment (no speculation rules prefetches) in blue, and the treatment (speculation rules prefetches) in orange, with the treatment dramatically faster than the control at every percentile. Remarkably, about 40% of eligible browsers saw their TTFB drop nearly to zero:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Time to first byte in the control and the experiment groups\" src=\"https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/f69a53/7378031331/inv_fullxfull.7378031331_hfrpx3ex.jpg?version=0\" title=\"Time to first byte in the control and the experiment groups\" />\n</figure>\n<p>We saw small but detectable improvements in some business metrics, which is promising given that listing page views come from many sources, only some of which are search results. As we implement more prefetching in more places, we hypothesize that the numbers will further improve.</p>\n<p>When people approach SRA implementation they may be worrying about unused prefetches and resource waste. In our experiment we saw a ratio of about 14:1 for the number of prefetches requested to subsequently activated pages (i.e., about 1 in 14 prefetch requests was navigated to by the user).</p>\n<p>We’re encouraged by these results, and are looking forward to new opportunities to improve performance across additional surfaces.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities to iterate and expand</h2>\n<p>One clear opportunity is to try implementing prefetching on other pages beyond Search. Shoppers end up on product listing pages from various other referral surfaces: shop pages, our SEO-optimized landing pages, home page, etc. Prefetching could improve performance on these surfaces, leading to a better experience for Etsy buyers. </p>\n<p>Another opportunity is to consider upgrading our <em>prefetching</em> to <em>prerendering</em> in the future. This would be a significant change to client-side JavaScript code operating during prefetches. However (and it's hard to contain the excitement about this!) Chrome is working on <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/428500219\"><code>prerender-until-script</code></a> update, which means prerendering stops at the first <code><script></code>. Even if you have <code><script></code> high up in the <code><head></code> of your page and prerendering halts early, the browser will still download page resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts) and have them ready. </p>\n<p>For our use case, enabling <code>prerender-until-script</code> would mean that frontend performance metrics downstream of TTFB, such as First/Largest Contentful Paint, would likely see even larger improvements, and users would be able to interact with the listing page even earlier. This would further reduce friction for users when browsing on Etsy, letting them spend less time watching web pages load and more time engaging directly with our sellers’ amazing inventory of items. </p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Implementing SRA was truly a cross-team effort, not only by the search front-end and web performance teams but also people from infrastructure, analytics, ranking, and recommendations. Special thanks to Paul Calvano from our Web Performance team, Diana Sanchez Urban from Search Experience Web, and Eileen Toomer from the Visits team! This project also benefited from input from members of Recommendations and Listing Page teams, as well as members of our internal Architecture Advisory Group.</p>",

In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard. Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.
