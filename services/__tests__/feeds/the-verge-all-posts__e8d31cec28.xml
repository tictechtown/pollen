<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s face it, it’s easy to fixate on the big gifts that crowd around the Christmas tree. However, we’d argue that the true treasures are the small, useful, and thoughtful gifts tucked within stockings. That’s why, for this guide, we’ve pooled together a bunch of tried-and-tested gadgets and goods to help bolster someone’s everyday carry or, at the very least, provide them with something that comes in clutch every once in a while. It certainly isn’t about gag gifts and cheap trinkets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is that many of the items we’ve highlighted in our guides to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/780844/best-gifts-under-25-2025">best gifts under $25</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/802969/best-gifts-under-50-2025">best gifts under $50</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/800440/best-gifts-under-100-2025">best gifts under $100</a> also meet the criteria for a good stocking stuffer, as most of them can easily fit in a bag and improve your daily routine. This includes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532LL-A-AirTag/dp/B0CWXNS552/">location tracker</a> for keeping tabs on your belongings, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D83J6JJ9/">pocket-friendly set of wireless earbuds</a>, and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001MX7PLG/">handy multitool</a> for making small repairs around the house, all of which can be found below.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<div class="product-block"><h3>Apple AirTag</h3>
<div class="product-description">AirTags can function as a second set of eyes for iPhone owners, allowing you to keep tabs on everything from your car keys to your backpack. That’s because the ultra wideband location trackers tap into Apple’s extensive Find My network, which allows for impressively precise tracking and lets users share the tracker with up to five other people for even greater peace of mind.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Baseus Free2Pull Retractable USB-C Cable 100W</h3>
<div class="product-description">Most people don&#8217;t want to wrangle cables… and who can blame them? Not us, which is why several folks at <em>The Verge</em> own Baseus&#8217; handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that&#8217;s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>The Landmark Project Prevent Wildfires Keychain</h3>
<div class="product-description">This Landmark Project keychain can add a bit of color and personality to an otherwise vanilla set of keys. The retro-inspired doohickey features a glossy emboss finish and harkens back to classic motel tags, while reminding you to respect the great outdoors. It’s also made of durable ABS plastic and features metal hardware, so it should withstand miles upon miles of abuse.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Anker Nano Travel Adapter</h3>
<div class="product-description">Anker’s Nano Travel Adapter is a versatile charger for globe-trotters. It features four plug types, providing compatibility in over 200 countries, along with an AC connector, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports. The adapter is also relatively tiny — each plug type either extends / retracts or folds up — so it’s easy to slot into your bag.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Iniu Pocket Rocket P50 power bank</h3>
<div class="product-description">Powerful power banks don&#8217;t have to be cumbersome. Iniu&#8217;s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>
<div class="product-description"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> breaks the mold of classic RPGs. The story is just as grandiose and gripping as the best <em>Final Fantasy </em>games, but by allowing you to dodge and parry every enemy attack, it flips more traditional turn-based combat on its head. Then there’s the score and visually striking world, both of which are just as refreshing to behold. </div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="Clair Obscur Expedition 33 for the PlayStation 5 on a white background." /></figure>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Field Notes “Flora” Edition</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Notes app is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “Flora” Edition can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Field-Notes-three-pack.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="Field Notes (three-pack) on a white background." /></figure>

<div class="product-block"><h3>LifeStraw Sip</h3>
<div class="product-description">The original LifeStraw was designed for those heading into the backcountry. The new LifeStraw Sip? Not so much. The reusable steel straw is geared more toward travelers than outdoor enthusiasts, though fortunately it still manages to remove about 99.99 percent of microplastics, bacteria, and parasites from your drinking water. </div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/MHGG-2025-Lifestraw-Sip.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<div class="product-block"><h3>OXO Sweep &amp; Swipe Laptop Cleaner</h3>
<div class="product-description">Crumbs don’t stand a chance on your keyboard with OXO’s laptop cleaner. The double-sided tool has a retractable soft brush that gets into tiny crevices to sweep away dust, and the microfiber pad can remove fingerprints and smudges on screens. I’ve been using one for the past few years, and it’s great for quickly tidying up after a long day of clacking away.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/OXO-Sweep-and-Swipe-Laptop-Cleaner.png?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="The OXO Sweep and Swipe Laptop Cleaner on a light gray background." /></figure>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Leatherman Skeletool CX</h3>
<div class="product-description">Leatherman’s Skeletool CX comes with a 25-year warranty and all the basics you need for everyday use. The convenient multitool conceals a sturdy steel blade, a pair of pliers, and a large bit driver within its compact build, which easily slides into your pocket. It’s the kind of gadget that proves you don’t need every tool under the sun just to get the job done.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Leatherman-Skeletool-CX.png?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<div class="product-block"><h3>CMF Buds Pro 2</h3>
<div class="product-description">CMF’s higher-end earbuds offer a lot for the price, including active noise cancellation and a transparency mode that should keep you aware of your surroundings. The charging case also has a smart dial that lets you adjust the volume and switch between noise modes, while multipoint support means the Buds Pro 2 can connect to two devices simultaneously.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>
<div class="product-description"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a bona fide system seller.

<div class="product-block"><h3>Amazon Smart Plug</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Amazon Smart Plug is a simple and inexpensive way to automate gadgets around your home. For instance, you can instruct Alexa to turn on a lamp that’s connected to the plug or control it via the Alexa app — no smart home hub required. The plug is compatible with most devices with an on / off switch, including fans, coffee makers, and other common household devices. It’s also great for controlling holiday lights.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Anbernic RG 34XXSP</h3>
<div class="product-description">If your giftee ever had a soft spot for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance SP, the RG 34XXSP won’t disappoint. Anbernic’s newer handheld emulator sports a classic clamshell design with a 3.4-inch 720p IPS display, as well as dual joysticks, four shoulder buttons, and a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for retro titles like <em>Golden Sun</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</em>.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Anker 140W 2-in-1 USB-C to USB-C Cable</h3>
<div class="product-description">Instead of sifting through a rat’s nest of cables, Anker’s dual-headed USB-C cable makes it easier to travel light. Thanks to its 2-in-1 design, you can charge two devices simultaneously — like a laptop and smartphone — with a peak power output of 140W. You don’t have to worry about the cable fraying, either, as it’s made from a durable braided nylon and has been tested to survive more than 10,000 bends.</div>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Amazon Kindle (2024)</h3>
<div class="product-description">There are few better ways to pass the time than getting lost in a good book (I’m reading Thomas Pynchon’s new <em>Shadow Ticket</em>). The latest base-model Kindle is our favorite cheap ebook reader, with a sharp 6-inch display, an adjustable frontlight, and a battery that lasts up to six weeks.

<div class="product-description">Leatherman’s compact Free T4 is a nice entry into the world of multitools, and the one I carry every day. Despite its smaller size, it features 12 tools, including a 420HC knife and spring-action scissors. My favorite is the combination package opener and awl, which is great for opening boxes and plastic blister packaging. Plus, it comes with Leatherman’s famed 25-year warranty.</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the self-induced tumult <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342282/sonos-app-redesign-controversy-full-story">Sonos has gone through</a> this year, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company’s products. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712262/sonos-ceo-tom-conrad-speakers-arc-ace">newly appointed CEO Tom Conrad</a> has shown that he’s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place now than it was last year, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It’s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction — and I took Sonos’ decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/628297/sonos-pinewood-streaming-box-canceled">cancel its video player</a> as a promising sign of renewed focus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company’s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don’t match — at least not without hassle. Most of the time, I’m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I’m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company’s recent speakers, you can do the same thing and <a href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/share-bluetooth-audio-with-your-sonos-system">spread that music across your entire Sonos system</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-you-should-trust-my-sonos-recommendations"><strong>Why you should trust my Sonos recommendations</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at <em>The Verge</em>. This has included reporting on the company’s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I’m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great — or just another also-ran product.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I wouldn’t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here, especially given that Sonos recently raised prices on a number of products&nbsp;— including soundbars and smart speakers — due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">ongoing tariff situation in the US</a>. The company still makes some genuinely terrific hardware, however, so if you’re wondering which are the true standouts, I’ve got you covered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker’s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (via <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-line-in-adapter">an optional dongle</a>). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, <em>finally</em>, dedicated track controls. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642013/sonos-era-100-ray-price-drop">dropped the Era 100’s price to $199</a> in April and then <em>raised</em> it again in September, though we’d argue that $219 is still fair for what you’re getting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sonos Five isn’t just Sonos’ best-sounding speaker; it’s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, the latest Echo Studio, and other mass market speakers — both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren’t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s nothing “smart” about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you’re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion — especially if you spring for a stereo pair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos’ much smaller Roam 2. It’s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There’s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. And like the Era 100, it uses a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24929138/DSCF2948_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Move 2 is both water-resistant and drop-resistant, so it’s built for handling your outdoor parties.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Move’s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you’ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can’t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You’ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don’t drop it into a pool.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I’m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it’s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Sonos Arc Ultra</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Arc Ultra surpasses the original Arc soundbar with more immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound, much better bass, and the ability to play music over Bluetooth.</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Introduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That’s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos’ newer SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that’s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783564/DSC_1412.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;That little indent makes it easier to find the Arc Ultra’s volume contrls.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that’s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it’s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Sonos Beam (Gen 2)</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Beam isn&#8217;t as powerful as the Sonos Arc, nor can it match the flagship soundbar&#8217;s Dolby Atmos immersion bubble. But you still get room-filling surround sound for less money — and the Beam ties into the Sonos ecosystem for added convenience.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888934/cwelch_290921_4780_5672.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="A photo of the white second-generation Sonos Beam soundbar in front of a TV" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be <em>too</em> powerful. If you’re in a smaller space or don’t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra’s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you’ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the same vein, unless you’re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $499 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $899 Sub 4 is Sonos’ flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company’s soundbars — and they’ve been ecstatic with the results.&nbsp;</p>

Smaller than most dogs.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you’re the type to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4o13mNmlaA">do a sub crawl</a> and put it somewhere in plain sight, I’d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4.&nbsp;</p>

The Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2), in particular, remains the most affordable gateway into the Sonos ecosystem, even with its recent price hike. Sound-wise, it’s not far off from the old Sonos One / Play:1 and is a very enjoyable speaker. Plus, the lower price tag makes it easier to convince yourself to scoop up two for a stereo pair.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boy oh boy, did Sonos’ wireless headphones come right at the worst possible moment. The company’s app crisis completely sidelined the Ace headphones. Some customers were also disappointed that the Ace can’t play music over Wi-Fi or be grouped with the company’s in-home speakers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But here’s the thing: the Ace headphones are still fantastic. They’re comfortable, have a gorgeous design (with easily swappable ear pads), and sound detailed, powerful, and expressive. They support wired audio over USB-C in addition to Bluetooth. And the TV Audio Swap feature is a useful perk that I still often use late at night when my Arc Ultra would disturb others. You can route any audio that would normally come through the soundbar — from your TV, gaming console, or streaming device — through two pairs of headphones and listen privately (with spatial audio surround sound). Sonos’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684672/sonos-ace-wireless-headphones-truecinema-software-update-available-now">new TrueCinema mode</a> even lets you fine-tune the latter to better reflect the acoustics of your space.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No, the Ace headphones aren’t what I’d consider the ideal of a wearable product from Sonos. But they remain a wholly impressive debut that fell victim to the company’s poor software decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The QC Ultra offer top-tier noise cancellation, allowing you to block out the chaos of the holidays. They also feature some of the best comfort you’ll find in this category, which is fitting considering the name. The design is lightweight, the ear cushions are nice and soft, and the headband features a relatively gentle clamping force, making them comfortable to wear over extended periods. They can also fold down for easy storage, while the battery can last up to 24 hours, so you don’t have to worry about charging while on the go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920591/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review">review</a>, former senior reviewer Chris Welch said the headphones put a bit more emphasis on bass than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review">Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700</a>, which the first-gen QC Ultra replaced. The overall sound is more detailed and preserves the lows and highs even when the volume is dialed down. The QC Ultra also support high-end features like wear detection, which will automatically pause your audio when you take them off, and a natural-sounding transparency mode that pipes in ambient noise to keep you aware of your surroundings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth flagging that Bose <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/772496/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-anc-wireless-headphones-second-generation-usb-c">introduced a new version</a> of the QC Ultra Headphones a few months ago with a higher starting price of $449 (though you can currently snag a pair <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0FDKQ2FG6/">at Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-black/J7C5V6W7LP/sku/6642778/">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen/QCUH2-HEADPHONEARN.html">Bose</a> for $50 off). While the latest model resembles the original, the second-gen headphones offer better battery life and several new features, including support for lossless audio over USB-C and an enhanced transparency mode that can filter out sudden noises. The first-gen version is still a great buy, though, and at just $279, a much better value right now.</p>
