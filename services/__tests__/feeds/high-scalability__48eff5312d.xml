Therefore the speed of accessing its data doesn&#x2019;t degrade the larger the log gets and, due to its immutability, it&#x2019;s efficient for concurrent reads.</p><p>But despite these benefits, the key benefit of the log and perhaps the chief reason it was chosen for Kafka is because it is optimized for HDDs.</p><p>HDDs are very efficient with relation to linear reads and writes, and due to the log&#x2019;s structure - linear reads/writes are the main thing you perform on it!</p><p><a href="https://highscalability.com/behind-aws-s3s-massive-scale/"><u>As we covered in our S3 article</u></a>, HDDs have become 6,000,000,000 times cheaper (inflation-adjusted) per byte since their inception. Kafka&#x2019;s architecture is optimized for a cost-efficient on-premise deployment of a system that stores a lot of data while also being very performant!</p><h1 id="performance">Performance</h1><p>A well-optimized on-premise Kafka deployment usually ends up being bottlenecked on the network, which is to say that it scales to many gigabytes per second of read and write throughput.</p><p>How does it achieve such performance? There are multiple optimizations - some macro and others micro.</p><h3 id="persistence-to-disk">Persistence to Disk</h3><p>Kafka actually stores all of its records to disk and doesn&#x2019;t keep anything explicitly in memory.</p><p>Kafka&#x2019;s protocol groups messages together. This allows network requests to group messages together and <strong>reduce network overhead</strong>.</p><p>The server, in turn, persists chunk of messages in one go - a linear HDD write. Consumers then fetch large linear chunks at once.</p><p>Linear reads/writes on a disk can be fast. HDDs are commonly discussed as slow because they are when you do numerous disk seeks, since you&#x2019;re bottlenecked on the physical movement of the drive&#x2019;s head as it moves to the new location. With a linear read/write, this isn&#x2019;t a problem as you continuously read/write data with the head&#x2019;s movement.</p><p>Going a step further - said linear operations are heavily optimized by the OS.</p><p><strong>Read-ahead optimizations</strong> prefetch large block multiples before they&#x2019;re requested and stores them in memory, resulting in the next read not touching the disk.</p><p><strong>Write-behind optimizations</strong> group small logical writes into big physical writes - Kafka does not use fsync, its writes get written to disk asynchronously.</p><h3 id="pagecache">Pagecache</h3><p>Modern OSes cache the disk in free RAM. This is called pagecache.</p><p>Since Kafka stores messages in a standardized binary format unmodified throughout the whole flow (producer &#x27A1; broker &#x27A1; consumer), it can make use of the <strong>zero-copy optimization</strong>.&#xA0;</p><p>Zero-copy, somewhat misleadingly named, is when the OS copies data from the pagecache directly to a socket, effectively bypassing Kafka&#x2019;s JVM entirely. There are still copies of the data being made - but they&#x2019;re reduced. This saves you a few extra copies and user &lt;-&gt; kernel mode switches.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hxbcAb64tRajQx8LfhDSv8H8pPO8H_gSXQkm--raNYUX8LrEgV548X8hSx005Fsj3s8-DUeeH5G4vWEesN3hWbj4JbzAbhKPh6UuQXlNlZROobfBM4SLGh1Ns1nXDeJW6h0wZGkVogGzPYJFv9myrE0" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>While it sounds cool, it&#x2019;s unlikely the zero-copy plays a large role in optimizing Kafka due to two main reasons - first, CPU is rarely the bottleneck in well-optimized Kafka deployments, so the lack of in-memory copies doesn&#x2019;t buy you a lot of resources.</p><p>Secondly, encryption and SSL/TLS (a must for all production deployments) already prohibit Kafka from using zero-copy due to modifying the message throughout its path. Despite this, Kafka still performs.</p><h1 id="back-to-basics">Back to Basics</h1><p>The nodes in the distributed system are called <strong><em>brokers</em></strong>.</p><p>Every topic is split into partitions, and the partitions themselves are replicated N times (according to the replication factor) into N replicas for durability and availability purposes.</p><p>A simple analogy is that just how the basic storage unit in an operating system is a file, the basic storage unit in Kafka is a replica (of a partition).</p><p>Each replica is nothing more than a few files itself, each of which embody the log data structure and sequentially form a larger log. Each record in the log is denoted by a specific offset, which is simply a monotonically-increasing number.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MNnq81Tq5oIxmLQO15lVpS3QakHOV9QUM3FDAXfd8KtDTrLLXhjKpTiu8fvdZdtXt1M2gfGkISv0zoT-dW6zexkBWPge-cgfKlrGBNgpDqduF84zHsLG4Do7PQ32qjdkpACaMkSe0MO39YYbZF_ZzKw" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="700" height="600"></figure><p>The replication is leader-based, which is to say that only a single broker leads a certain partition at a time.</p><p>Every partition has a set of replicas (called the &#x201C;replica set&#x201D;). A replica can be in two states - in-sync or out-of-sync. As the name suggests, out-of-sync replicas are ones that don&#x2019;t have the latest data for the partition.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VZt5mDe2_pKfSgKJXBFkVCs9HApzHRT69raARrqfoJKfhapjMHImjinQom0H13d5ALd56lNNLHFNFHK_wQzU7SxxO_YdbyiplV6aUv7-6u5RkO0GgdBaedio8ToMZrinA3_qerdnod3mXStN5xR3qwo" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1292" height="727"></figure><h2 id="writes">Writes</h2><p>Writes can only go to that leader, which then asynchronously replicates the data to the N-1 followers.</p><p>Clients that write data are called <strong>producers</strong>. Producers can configure the durability guarantees they want to have during writes via the &#x201C;acks&#x201D; property which denotes how many brokers have to acknowledge a write before the response is returned to the client.</p><p>- &#xA0; acks=0 - the producer won&#x2019;t even wait for a response from the broker, it immediately considers the write successful</p><p>- &#xA0; acks=1 - a response is sent to the producer when the leader acknowledges the record (persists it to disk).</p><p>- &#xA0; acks=all (the default) - a response is sent to the producer only when <strong>all of the in-sync replicas</strong> persist the record.</p><p>To further control the acks=all property and ensure it doesn&#x2019;t regress to an acks=1 property when there is only one in-sync replica, the `min.insync.replicas` setting exists to denote the minimum number of in-sync replicas required to acknowledge a write that&#x2019;s configured with `acks=all`.</p><h2 id="reads">Reads</h2><p>Clients that read data are called <strong>consumers</strong>. Similarly, they&#x2019;re client applications that use the Kafka library to read data from there and do some processing on it.</p><p>Kafka Consumers have the ability to read from any replica, and are typically configured to read from the closest one in the network topology.</p><p>Consumers form so-called <strong><em>consumer groups</em></strong>, which are simply a bunch of consumers who are logically grouped and synchronized together. They synchronize each other through talking to the broker - they are not connected to one another. They persist their progress (up to what offset they&#x2019;ve consumed from any given partition) in a particular partition of a special Kafka topic called `__consumer_offsets`. The broker that is the leader of the partition acts as the so-called <strong>Group Coordinator</strong> for that consumer group, and it is this Coordinator that is responsible for maintaining the consumer group membership and liveliness.</p><p>The records in any single partition are ordered within it. Consumers are guaranteed to read it in the right order. To ensure that the order is preserved, the consumer group protocol ensures that no two consumers in the same consumer group can read from the same partition.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/j4wr_ABfOJlQYMv_-APWyL8oRCI9OhHc5e_P9U6OCaO1fbowZDaaMpALSyBQFe9QbK08D_fNq12ezSS-BAVYWdOo42OX8ir4qD-ZffrImLlrcxQ5o3yjcggW_S4z0lme0ZJ41u9n4LqB2o7136lBBwc" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1292" height="727"></figure><p>There can be many different consumer groups reading from the same topic.</p><p>One core reason that made Kafka win over the traditional message bus technologies was precisely this decoupling of producer and consumer clients. In some systems, the messages would be deleted the moment they&#x2019;re consumed, which creates coupling. If the consumers were slow, the system may risk running out of memory and impacting the producers. Kafka doesn&#x2019;t suffer from this issue because it persists the data to disk, and due to the aforementioned optimizations, it can still remain performant.</p><h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2><p>Clients connect to the brokers via TCP using the Kafka protocol.</p><p>The producer/consumer clients are simple Java libraries that implement the Kafka protocol. Implementations exist in virtually every other language out there.</p><h1 id="fault-tolerance">Fault Tolerance</h1><p>An Apache Kafka cluster always has one broker who is the active Controller of the cluster. The Controller supports all kinds of administrative actions that require a single source of truth, like creating and deleting topics, adding partitions to topics, reassigning partition replicas.</p><p>Its most impactful responsibility is handling leader election of each partition. Because all the centralized metadata about the cluster is processed by the Controller, it decides when and to what broker a partition&#x2019;s leadership changes to. This is most notable in failover cases where a leader broker dies, or even when it is shutting down. In both of these cases, the Controller reacts by gracefully switching the partition leadership to another broker in the replica set.</p><h1 id="consensus">Consensus</h1><p>Any distributed system requires consensus - the act of picking exactly one broker to be the controller at any given time is fundamentally a distributed consensus problem.</p><p>Kafka historically outsourced consensus to ZooKeeper. When starting the cluster up, every broker would race to register the `/controller` zNode and the first one to do so would be crowned the controller. Similarly, when the current Controller died - the first broker to register the zNode subsequently would be the new controller.</p><p>Kafka used to persist all sorts of metadata in ZooKeeper, including the alive set of brokers, the topic names and their partition count, as well as the partition assignments.</p><p>Kafka also used to heavily leverage ZooKeeper&#x2019;s watch mechanism, which would notify a subscriber whenever a certain zNode changed.</p><p>For the last few years, Kafka has actively been moving away from ZooKeeper towards its own consensus mechanism called KRaft (&#x201C;Kafka Raft&#x201D;).</p><p>It is a dialect of Raft with a few differences, heavily influenced by Kafka&#x2019;s existing replication protocol. Most basically said, it extends the Kafka replication protocol with a few Raft-related features.</p><p>A key realization is that the cluster&#x2019;s metadata can be easily expressed in a regular log through the ordered record of events that happened in the cluster. Brokers could then replay these events to build up to the latest state of the system.</p><p>In this new model, Kafka has a quorum of N controllers (usually 3). These brokers host a special topic called the metadata topic (&#x201C;__cluster_metadata&#x201D;).</p><p>This topic has a single partition whose leader election is managed by Raft (as opposed to the Controller for every other topic). The leader of the partition becomes the currently active Controller. The other controllers act as hot standbys, storing the latest metadata in memory.</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rCWoO0Ha2O0SrdNx9oncgasZx3j3ZbvQ5dLdkFU6RPGR7Ef1EShjCDz_WcBzLccqhyWps7NMTzhcbIu4PehnzXkWbRrP1WnMU7SjQvrRE-d4a6AS3k0oTRuHCmT26YsmjacwcJeq4gPnCQ-9c8Yz6fA" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1292" height="727"></figure><p>All regular brokers replicate this topic too. Instead of having to directly communicate to the controller, they asynchronously update their metadata simply by keeping up with the topic&#x2019;s latest records.</p><p>KRaft supports two modes of deployment - combined and isolated mode. Combined is similar to the model under ZooKeeper, where a broker can serve the role of both a regular broker and a controller at once. Isolated is when the controllers are deployed solely as controllers and serve no other function besides that.</p><p>The first Kafka release that featured a production-ready KRaft version was Kafka 3.3, released in October 2022. ZooKeeper is set to be completely removed in the next major Kafka release - 4.0 (expected around Q3 2024).</p><h1 id="tiered-storage">Tiered Storage</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, Kafka&#x2019;s architecture was optimized for a cost-efficient on-premise deployment. Since then, the proliferation of cloud has certainly changed the way we architect software.</p><p>One of the architectural choices that become glaringly nonoptimal once Kafka took off was its decision to colocate the storage with the broker. Brokers host all of the data on their local disk, which brings a few challenges with it, especially at scale.</p><p>First, as Kafka is meant to be the central nervous system of a company&#x2019;s architecture, it&#x2019;s not uncommon to want to have brokers that store 3TB of historical data on them - this results in 9TB total assuming the default replication factor of 3.</p><p>When a broker has close to 10TB of data locally, you start to see issues when things go wrong.</p><p>One evident problem is handling ungraceful shutdowns - when a broker recovers from an ungraceful shutdown, it has to rebuild all the local log index files associated with its partitions in a process called <strong>log recovery</strong>. With a 10TB disk, this can take hours if not days in certain cases.</p><p>Another problem is historical reads. Kafka&#x2019;s performance relies heavily on the assumption that consumers are reading from the tail of the log, which in practice means they&#x2019;re reading from memory due to the pagecache containing the latest produced data. If a consumer fetches historical data, this usually forces the Kafka broker to read it from the HDD. HDDs <a href="https://highscalability.com/behind-aws-s3s-massive-scale/"><u>have historically been stuck at 120 IOPS</u></a> for a long time, which is to say that it&#x2019;s really easy to exhaust that resource. This means the consumers compete with the producers for IOPS and once that gets depleted, performance tanks.</p><p>The IOPS problem becomes amplified during hard failure scenarios. If a broker has a hard failure of its disk, it starts up with an empty disk and has to replicate all that 10TB of data from scratch. This process can take up to a day itself depending on the free bandwidth, and during that time said broker is issuing historical reads on many other brokers. One such failure amplifies into a lot of historical reads - the impact can be much more severe if a whole availability zone experiences a hard failure.</p><p>The final case where the amount of data becomes problematic is in rebalancing scenarios. Kafka allows you to reassign the replicas of any partition - and that involves moving all of the data along with it.</p><p>As a simple example, take a partition that has a replica set of brokers [0,1,2]. Usually, the first replica is the leader - hence broker 0 is leading that partition. If you want to introduce new replicas, they will start off as an out of sync replica and have to read all of the partition&#x2019;s data from the leader 0 before becoming an in-sync replica.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/z-RAQ4Mi-LD0OmN2ekm66xEvlqoXmifT27HweN1xPFNczSYYjI_ZRLJLP64BY11mg33kq-EcviI8ODqXdS0dNGHuMfZBPNBX_SQ1kUf7j-8FpaLeepsmDLOW3DhERqc-QWSA_BXWk8k7n7wpIeHpVwo" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>If you add more nodes to your Kafka cluster, for example, you have to reassign some subset of partition replicas to those new brokers, otherwise they would remain empty. The reassignment process has the receiving broker copy all of the data for the given replicas, which not only can use up precious IOPS itself due to its historical nature, but also take a very long time.</p><p>Apache Kafka is solving all of these issues by introducing a feature called <a href="https://2minutestreaming.beehiiv.com/p/apache-kafka-kip-405-tiered-storage?ref=highscalability.com"><u>Tiered Storage</u></a> - the simple idea of storing most of the data in a remote object store (e.g S3). While still in Early Access, Kafka now has two tiers of storage - the hot local storage and the cold remote storage - both abstracted away seamlessly.</p><p>In this new mode, leader brokers are responsible for tiering the data into the object store. Once tiered, both leader and follower brokers can read from the object store to serve historical data.</p><p>This feature nicely solves all the aforementioned problems as brokers no longer need to copy massive amounts of data and historical reads no longer exhaust IOPS. Tests from development showed a 43% producer performance improvement when historical consumers were present. Depending on the object store, this can result in saving cost too as you&#x2019;re outsourcing the replication and durability guarantees.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/t6h5gVPLXF_PHcO7ODSFtptqdblZjW9O6m79QeXoSAo_on_uFg1NYlYnLLvG-IJkJlI5GqVO9FSUzKipq62Raqtk8oXewZ44zw7L6ovdtL9-saWr_rSjcRpon-iXNdXFd_jCy9g8e246H_ulz4i97cM" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="700" height="600"></figure><h1 id="auxiliary-systems">Auxiliary Systems</h1><h1 id="rebalancing">Rebalancing</h1><p>Reassigning partitions is a key necessity in any Kafka cluster that&#x2019;s seeing non-trivial usage.</p><p>Since it&#x2019;s a distributed system with varying client workloads, the system can easily develop hot spots or inefficient resource distribution throughout its lifecycle.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jYfKp2TzNcX2MIavsuoFvBCQPToX7UOfn5Dsr2TAXpjTW2aQDUFYIwrb8tTaADaoRuNQetnUwR4ZC9iU81g6YTtuJ5W7CunAvEBjqBjsRqxYrzdlLyWrAVHvrLiB8eJnHZzuGtAJ-kUyMHAwnG7UBqQ" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>To alleviate this, Kafka exposes a low-level API that allows you to reassign partitions.

Once it has computed a more efficient model, it begins incrementally applying it to the cluster by leveraging the low-level Kafka reassignment API.</p><p>Without going too much into detail, Cruise Control exposes a configurable set of rebalancing logic consisting of multiple `Goal`s, each of which is ran with its associated priority and balances on its associated resource.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kv4hhXdLiebuH-1c9VEuwRVD04pGO9ACrdRqoHKqxGk3Uj_uh6jr89fnlYGXWIx6nK0ZqbtmdYJzZ7dBeFbOYm3xaB-s8EjO3CUqYxTM89NWjRRW7qf-K9wQhUrmYyZkGjp563Qd2iJUIKM4mf34Ylk" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>Cruise Control continuously monitors the cluster&#x2019;s metrics and automatically triggers a rebalance once it notices the metrics going outside of its defined acceptable thresholds.</p><p>Notably, Cruise Control also exposes API to allow you to easily add brokers to a cluster or remove brokers from a cluster.

These Connectors come in two flavors:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Source Connector</em></strong> &#x2014; used when sourcing data from another system (the source) and writing it to Kafka.</li><li><strong><em>Sink Connector</em></strong> &#x2014; used when sourcing data from Kafka and writing it to another system (the sink).</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/szaEtrXBRLq1hluaRBKTkRKUZoZsR76VfuwhAGDa5IVIsbO86ZaSOFCwV24npxQCTrGi0H7dRQRvr4BDCZnfjpDHhphtEOPfYGU0cbIzh11SDV-PBOtF7wQDeriM3bXQP3akGuenpQyOGeV35fNP1-w" class="kg-image" alt="Kafka 101" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="939"></figure><p><em>In the diagram above we see two Source connectors running in two separate Connect clusters, each with its own workers, ingesting MongoDB/PostgreSQL data into Kafka.</em></p><p><em>A separate Connect cluster running Sink connectors then takes said data from Kafka and ingests it into Snowflake.</em></p><h1 id="kafka-streams">Kafka Streams</h1><p>A stream processor is usually a client that reads the continuous streams of data from its input topics, performs some processing on this input, and produces a stream of data to output topics (or external services, databases, etc). In Kafka, It&#x2019;s possible to do simple processing directly with the regular producer/consumer APIs; however, for more complex transformations like joining streams together, Kafka provides a integrated Streams API library.</p><p>Another part of the Apache open-source project, Kafka Streams is a client library that exposes a high-level API for processing, transforming and enriching data in real time.&#xA0;</p><p>This API is intended to be used within your own codebase &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not running on a broker. Unlike other stream processing frameworks, this one is native to Kafka and therefore doesn&#x2019;t require a separate complex deployment strategy - it is deployed as a regular Kafka client, usually within your application.</p><p>It works similar to the consumer API and helps you scale out the stream processing work over multiple applications (similar to consumer groups).</p><p>Most notably, it supports exactly-once <strong><em>processing</em></strong> semantics when its input and output is a Kafka topic.</p><h1 id="optimizations-future-work">Optimizations / Future Work</h1><p>While Kafka can seem like old software (it was first released in 2011!), the community is actively innovating on top of the protocol.</p><p>At this point, evidence points that the future will be everybody standardizing on the Kafka API and competing on the underlying implementation.</p><p>The current leader in the space is Confluent, founded by the original creators of Kafka, who have developed a <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p3822-povzner.pdf?ref=highscalability.com"><u>cloud-native Kafka engine called Kora</u></a>.</p><p>Notable competitors include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEVL8cLUFOc&amp;ref=highscalability.com"><u>RedPanda</u></a>, which re-wrote Kafka in C++ and <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/overview/architecture?ref=highscalability.com"><u>WarpStream</u></a>, which innovated with a new architecture that leverages S3 heavily, completely avoiding replication and broker statefulness.</p><p>Vendors are largely competing in the cloud today - many offer a Kafka SaaS with varying levels of support. Some vendors offer a proper serverless SaaS experience by abstracting a lot of the details away, while others still require users to understand the details of the system and in some cases manage a large part of it themselves.&#xA0;</p><p>In summary, Kafka is mature, widely-adopted software that provides a rich set of features.</p><p>It is open source and boasts a very healthy community that continues to innovate stronger than ever after 13 years of development.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Capturing A Billion Emo(j)i-ons]]></title><description><![CDATA[<blockquote>This blog post was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dedeepya-bonthu-a304abba/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noreferrer">Dedeepya Bonthu</a>.

To prevent hogging the client connection, heavy processing on the API needs to be done offline. We need to write the data somewhere so processing applications can consume it.&#xA0;<strong>Message Queue</strong>&#xA0;is a commonly used mechanism for asynchronous communication between applications.</p><p>There are a lot of message queues available out there. A comparison of some of the available Message Queues is reviewed in this&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/17/comparing-big-data-messaging.html?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">blog</a>. For&#xA0;<strong>Emojis</strong>, we needed a technology that offered high throughput, availability, low latency and supports consumer groups.&#xA0;<strong>Kafka</strong>&#xA0;seemed like the best option but managing Kafka on our own takes significant effort. Thankfully, Hotstar has an amazing data platform called&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.hotstar.com/data-democratisation-hotstar-93ebfb1e688d?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"><strong><em>Knol</em></strong></a>&#xA0;built on top of Kafka which is flexible for all our use cases.</p><h2 id="how-do-we-write-messages-to-the-queue"><strong>How do we write messages to the queue?</strong></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1202/1*JISr-cM9nj3wbtYcAGvqTw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Capturing A Billion Emo(j)i-ons" loading="lazy" width="601" height="127"></figure><p><strong>Synchronous</strong>: Wait for the acknowledgment that the message is written before sending a success response to clients. In case of a failure, we could have retries configured at both server and client. If your data is transactional or cannot suffer any loss, this approach is preferable.</p><p><strong>Asynchronous:&#xA0;</strong>Write the message to a local buffer and respond with success to clients. Messages from the buffer could be written asynchronously to the queue. The downside is that if not handled properly, this could result in data loss.</p><p>For&#xA0;<em>Emojis</em>, we need very low latency and data loss in rare scenarios is not a big concern (<em>although we haven&#x2019;t seen any so far</em>). So we chose the Asynchronous approach.</p><p><strong><em>Golang</em></strong>&#xA0;has great support for concurrency. It ships with an implementation called Goroutines. Goroutines are lightweight threads that can execute functions asynchronously. We just need to say&#xA0;<code>go do_something()</code>. We use&#xA0;<a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Goroutines</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Channels</a>&#xA0;in Golang to write messages to Kafka. Messages to be produced are written to a Channel. A Producer runs in the background as a Goroutine and flushes the data periodically to Kafka. Using client libraries like&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"><em>Confluent</em></a>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/sarama?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"><em>Sarama</em></a>, we can provide the flush configuration to achieve optimal performance. We configured our flush interval to&#xA0;<code>500ms</code>&#xA0;and maximum messages sent to Kafka broker in a single request to&#xA0;<code>20000</code>.</p><h2 id="how-does-the-processing-happen"><strong>How does the processing happen?</strong></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1202/1*dUoAgXg2ck-bsthn4sKiPw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Capturing A Billion Emo(j)i-ons" loading="lazy" width="601" height="127"></figure><p><strong>Goal</strong>: Consume a stream of data from Kafka and compute aggregates of the data over an interval. Time interval should be small enough to provide a real-time experience to users.</p><p>After considering different streaming frameworks like Flink, Spark, Storm, Kafka Streams we decided to go with Spark. Spark has support for micro batching and aggregations which are essential for our use case and better community support compared to competitors like Flink.

PubSub is a real-time messaging infrastructure built at Hotstar to deliver messages to users in our Social Feed. You can dig deeper into the journey of PubSub in&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.hotstar.com/building-pubsub-for-50m-concurrent-socket-connections-5506e3c3dabf?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">this article</a>.</p><p>We wrote a simple Kafka consumer in Python. Consumption rate depends on the batch duration configured in the Spark job. Let&#x2019;s say that it&#x2019;s set to 1 second, this consumer would receive a message per second. We perform normalization over the data and send top (relatively more popular) emojis to PubSub. Clients receive messages from PubSub and show&#xA0;<em>Emojis&#xA0;</em>animation to users.</p><h2 id="impact">Impact</h2><p>Emojis are a huge hit at Hotstar. We received around 5 Billion Emojis from 55.83 Million users during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. This system has captured more than 6.5 Billion Emojis to date.

There were often major concurrency issues, where we&#x2019;d dispatch two cars to one person or one driver would be matched to two different riders. <em>(Learn more about </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO83dyxa0Vo&amp;ref=highscalability.com"><em>Uber&#x2019;s earliest architecture from founding engineer Curtis Chambers</em></a><em>).</em></p><p>But the product caught on. It was time to build the tech foundations from scratch.</p><h2 id="setting-up-for-global-scale">Setting up for Global Scale</h2><p><em>Circa 2011</em></p><p>To architect a better and more scalable solution, we needed to address those concurrency problems. Additionally, we needed a system that can process tons of real-time data. Not only are there requests from riders, but Uber needs to track driver real-time locations in order to match riders as efficiently as possible. Finally, the product was still early and would require a lot of testing and iteration. We needed a solution to solve all these scenarios.</p><p>Uber adopted <a href="https://nodejs.org/en?ref=highscalability.com">Node.js</a> for their real-time needs. And ended up being <a href="https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2017/09/Nodejs-at-Uber.pdf?ref=highscalability.com">one of the first major adopters of Node.js</a> in production. Node.js was ideal for a few reasons. First, Node.js handles requests asynchronously (using a non-blocking, single-threaded event loop) and so can process significant amounts of data quickly. Second, Node.js runs on the <a href="https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/?ref=highscalability.com">V8 JavaScript engine</a>, so not only is it performant, but it&#x2019;s excellent for quick iteration.</p><p>Uber then created a second service built in Python to handle business logic functions like authentication, promotions, and fare calculation.</p><p>The resulting architecture was two services. One built in Node.js (&quot;dispatch&quot;) connected to MongoDB (later Redis) and the other built in Python (&quot;API&quot;) connected to PostgreSQL. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQHXn3LtSPZV1g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1704823120539?e=1715817600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=MG8vvgwq-LNlZvJS_0Cqb2bPfsEfQea04tSMB2XeEzA" class="kg-image" alt="Brief History of Scaling Uber" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="616"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Uber&#x2019;s two monolith architecture allowed the engineering org to begin to scale</span></figcaption></figure><p>And to improve the resiliency of Uber&#x2019;s core dispatching flow, a layer between dispatch and API known as &quot;ON&quot; or Object Node was built to withstand any disruptions within the API service.

Service oriented architectures can be very powerful. As you carve out services to handle more dedicated functionality, it has a side benefit of allowing easier separation of engineers into dedicated teams. Which then allows for more rapid team scaling.</p><p>But as the team and number of features grew, the API service was getting bigger and bigger. More and more features were conflicting with one another. Engineering productivity was slowing down. There were huge risks continuously deploying the codebase.</p><p>It was time to split out <strong>API</strong> into proper services.</p><h2 id="from-monolith-to-microservices">From Monolith to Microservices</h2><p><em>Circa 2013</em></p><p>To prepare for our next phase of growth, Uber decided to <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/service-oriented-architecture/?ref=highscalability.com">adopt a microservice architecture</a>. This design pattern enforces the development of small services dedicated to specific, well-encapsulated domain areas (e.g. rider billing, driver payouts, fraud detection, analytics, city management). Each service can be written in its own language or framework, and can have its own database or lack thereof. However, many backend services utilized Python and many started to adopt <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/building-tincup-microservice-implementation/?ref=highscalability.com">Tornado</a> to provide asynchronous response functionality. By 2014, we had roughly 100 services.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQEM_dZ1PkeslQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1704823274941?e=1715817600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=yFy1inqNC9TJi5BQwlyQOBGsnTjWWjxKjfzPC0Mb4v8" class="kg-image" alt="Brief History of Scaling Uber" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="600"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Uber&#x2019;s API monolith to microservice migration</span></figcaption></figure><p>While microservices can solve many problems, it also introduces <em>significant operational complexity</em>. You must only adopt microservices after <a href="https://joshclemm.com/writing/want-to-move-to-microservices/?ref=highscalability.com">understanding the tradeoffs</a> and potentially build or leverage tools to counteract those tradeoffs. And if you don&#x2019;t consider the operational issues, you will simply create a <a href="https://www.microservices.com/talks/dont-build-a-distributed-monolith/?ref=highscalability.com">distributed monolith</a>.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s some examples of the issues microservices create and what Uber did to address. </p><ul><li>To ensure all services use <strong>standardized service frameworks</strong>, we developed <a href="https://github.com/uber/clay?ref=highscalability.com">Clay</a>. This was a Python wrapper on <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/?ref=highscalability.com">Flask</a> to build restful backend services. It gave us consistent monitoring, logging, HTTP requests, consistent deployments, etc. </li><li>To <strong>discover and talk to other services</strong> and provide service <strong>resilience</strong> (fault tolerance, rate limiting, circuit breaking), Uber built <a href="https://github.com/uber/tchannel?ref=highscalability.com">TChannel</a> over <a href="https://github.com/uber/hyperbahn?ref=highscalability.com">Hyperbahn</a>. TChannel as our bi-directional RPC protocol was built in-house mainly to gain better performance and forwarding for our Node and Python services, among other benefits. </li><li>To ensure <strong>well-defined RPC interfaces</strong> and stronger contracts across services, Uber used <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/?ref=highscalability.com">Apache Thrift</a>. </li><li>To prevent <strong>cross-service capability</strong> issues, we use <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/flipr/?ref=highscalability.com">Flipr</a> to feature flag code changes, control rollouts, and many other config-based use cases. </li><li>To improve the <strong>observability</strong> of all service metrics, we built <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/m3/?ref=highscalability.com">M3</a>. M3 allows any engineer easy ways to observe the state of their service both offline or through Grafana dashboards.

And we continued to use Node.js for it. The service was a single repository that was broken up into multiple specialized deployment groups to support our growing businesses.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQFAxwUnjXQp3A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1704823458539?e=1715817600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=6v_V2QJSefx0Dp7qNCB5142TXLWNwpglYp_NAmwex1I" class="kg-image" alt="Brief History of Scaling Uber" loading="lazy" width="1160" height="504"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">RTAPI provided a powerful new real-time layer that maintain high development velocity</span></figcaption></figure><p>The gateway provided a very flexible development space for writing new code and had access to the hundreds of services within the company. For instance, the first generation of Uber Eats was completely developed within the gateway. As the team&apos;s product matured, pieces were moved out of the gateway and into proper services.</p><p><strong>Rewriting Dispatch for Uber&#x2019;s Growing Size</strong></p><p>The original dispatch service was designed for more simplistic transportation (one driver-partner and one rider). There were deep assumptions that Uber only needed to move people and not food or packages. Its state of available driver-partners was sharded by city. And some cities were seeing massive growth of the product.</p><p>So, dispatch was rewritten into a series of services. The new dispatch system needed to understand much more about the types of vehicles and rider needs.</p><p>It took on advanced matching optimizations, essentially to solve a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem?ref=highscalability.com">traveling salesman problem</a>. Not only did it look at the ETAs of currently available driver-partners, but needed to understand which drivers could be available in the near future. So we had to build a geospatial index to capture this information. We used <a href="https://s2geometry.io/?ref=highscalability.com">Google&#x2019;s S2 library</a> to segment cities into areas of consideration and used the S2 cell ID as the sharding key. <em>(We&#x2019;ve since updated to and </em><a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/?ref=highscalability.com"><em>open-sourced H3</em></a><em>)</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQEvvNKz6Z4ppA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1704823497565?e=1715817600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=4BoCndLU8E_EH8luLygip1bT3085FjTB96mVBRJlvAU" class="kg-image" alt="Brief History of Scaling Uber" loading="lazy" width="1404" height="654"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Overview of dispatch stack</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since these services were still running on Node.js and were stateful, we needed a way to scale as the business grew.

As Uber continued to expand city by city, local operations folks were hired to ensure their city launch would go successfully. They had tools to ensure their local marketplace would remain healthy and the flywheel would grow. As a result, Uber had a very distributed and decentralized culture. And that helped contribute to Uber&#x2019;s success in getting to 600 cities by 2018.</p><p>That culture of decentralization continued within engineering, where one of our earliest cultural values was &quot;Let Builders Build&quot;. This resulted in rapid engineering development that complemented Uber&#x2019;s success growing across the globe. </p><p>But after many years, it resulted in the proliferation of microservices (thousands by 2018), thousands of code repositories, multiple product solutions solving very similar problems, and multiple solutions to common engineering problems. For example, there were different messaging queue solutions, varying database options, communication protocols, and even many choices for programming languages..</p><blockquote>&quot;You&apos;ve got five or six systems that do incentives that are 75 percent similar to one another&quot; - Former Uber CTO Thuan Pham</blockquote><p>Developer productivity was hurting.</p><p>Engineering leadership recognized it was time for more standardization and consistency and formed <a href="https://stanford.edu/dept/gsb-ds/Inkling/Uber_Repaying_Technical_and_Organizational_Debt/index.html?ref=highscalability.com#">Project Ark</a>.

We defined more standardized architectural layers where client, presentation, product, and business logic would have clear homes. We introduced abstractions where we could group a number of services together (service &quot;<a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/microservice-architecture/?ref=highscalability.com">domains</a>&quot;).

Next, we have a large geographical footprint and need to regularly expand into more data centers and availability zones. Finally, with only on-prem machines, we were constantly needing to tune the size of our fleet.</p><p>We spent the last few years working towards making over <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/uber-up-cloud-microservices/?ref=highscalability.com">4000 of our stateless microservices portable</a>. And to ensure our stack would work equally well across cloud and on-prem environments, we embarked on <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/crane-ubers-next-gen-infrastructure-stack/?ref=highscalability.com">Project Crane</a> to solve.

In essence - a scalable multi-tenant storage service which provides interfaces to store and retrieve objects with extremely high availability and durability at a relatively low cost. Customers share all of the underlying hardware.</p><p>It is one of the most popular services in AWS.</p><p>Through 18 years since its release in 2006, it has grown into a behemoth of an offering, spanning 31 regions and 99 availability zones as well as boasting numbers that show ground-breaking scale:</p><ul><li>100 million requests a second</li><li>400 terabits a second</li><li>280 trillion objects stored</li></ul><p>Here is a short timeline of the major features ever since its release:</p><ul><li>2006: S3 officially launched</li><li>2012: Glacier - a low-cost service for data archiving and long-term backup - introduced (retrieval times take minutes to hours)</li><li>2013: S3 Intelligent-Tiering - a feature that automatically moves your data the most cost-effective access tier</li><li>2015: Standard-Infrequent Access - a new tier for data that&#x2019;s less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed</li><li>2018: Glacier Deep Archive - cheaper Glacier with much slower retrieval times (12 hours)</li><li>2020: Strong read-after-write consistency introduced</li><li>2021: Object Lambda - allow customers to add their own code to S3 GET requests, modifying data as its returned to an application</li><li>2023 - S3 Express released, offering 10x better latencies (single-digit) and 50% cheaper request costs.</li></ul><p>It started as a service optimized for backups, video and image storage for e-commerce websites - but eventually grew in scale and demand to support being the main storage system used for analytics and machine learning on massive data lakes.

It is said that this continues recursively - the boxes in the chart contain their own individual nested components with their own teams and fleets. In many ways, they all operate like independent businesses.</p><p>The way each team interacts with others is literal API-level contracts, for which engineers are on the hook for keeping up.</p><h1 id="storage-fleet">Storage Fleet</h1><p>S3 is just a really big system built out of A LOT (millions) of hard disks.</p><p>At the core of all of this are the <strong>storage node servers</strong>. They are simple key-value stores that persist object data to hard disks. The node servers only shards of the overall object data, with the control plane replicating said shards across many different nodes.</p><p>AWS has written a lot about their newly-written storage backend - ShardStore. It initially started with just 40k lines of Rust.</p><p>Under the hood, it&#x2019;s a simple log-structured merge tree (LSM Tree) with shard data stored outside the tree to reduce write amplification.</p><p>It uses a soft-updates-based crash consistency protocol and is designed from the ground up to support extensive concurrency. It leverages several optimizations to support efficient HDD IO usage like scheduling of operations and coalescing.</p><p>This is perhaps the most key piece of code in S3 and as such, its development process is highly invested in. AWS has <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/papers/shardstore-sosp21.poster.pdf?ref=highscalability.com"><u>written at length about the lightweight formal verification methods</u></a> they&#x2019;ve integrated into their developers&#x2019; workflows.</p><h1 id="hard-drives">Hard Drives</h1><p>Hard drives are an old technology that&#x2019;s not ideal for all use cases - they&#x2019;re constrained for IOPS, they have high seek latency and are physically fragile.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worth stepping back and checking their evolution:</p><ul><li>1956: a 3.75MB drive cost $9k</li><li>2024: 26TB drives exist, where 1TB costs $15</li></ul><p>In their existence, they&apos;ve seen exponential improvement:</p><ul><li>price: 6,000,000,000 times cheaper per byte (in inflation-adjusted $)</li><li>capacity increased 7,200,000 times</li><li>size decreased 5,000 times</li><li>weight decreased 1,235x</li></ul><p>But one problem persists - they&#x2019;re constrained for IOPS. They have been stuck at 120 IOPS for a long time. Similarly, the latency has not kept up in the same pace as the rest.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KYXFvwFFdKr8QO6az7MXE94N1DBOnW8_Vuqa-0-MaZQzMexYSeaP7WN_KYmtYpIgAPuyOxJMSdCH5yMKKj-KkL95cGBJZCiToCtJ_-PXh8bzZ-eerBd6ZYyzFBVLPqJaiAlLjZhG53teeBolWGHoAvQ" class="kg-image" alt="Behind AWS S3&#x2019;s Massive Scale" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="841"></figure><p>This means that per byte, <strong>HDDs are becoming slower</strong>.</p><p>In an increasingly latency-sensitive world, it&#x2019;s hard for an HDD to keep up with the demanding requirements modern systems have.</p><p>Yet, S3 found a way to deliver tolerable latency while working around this - it heavily leverages parallel IO.</p><h1 id="replication">Replication</h1><p>In storage systems, redundancy schemes are a common practice.</p><p>They are most often associated with extra durability - helping protect data against hardware failures. If one disk fails, a copy of the data remains present in another disk, hence it isn&#x2019;t lost.</p><p>An under-appreciated aspect of these redundancy schemes is <strong>managing heat</strong>. Such schemes spread the load out and give your system the flexibility to direct read traffic in a balanced way.</p><p>S3 uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction?ref=highscalability.com"><u>Erasure Coding</u></a> (EC). It&#x2019;s a complex data protection method which breaks data into K shards with M redundant &#x201C;parity&#x201D; shards. EC allows you to recover the data from any K shards out of the total K+M total shards.&#xA0;</p><p>e.g. break data into 10 fragments, add 6 parity shards. You can lose up to 6 shards.</p><p>Replication is expensive from a durability perspective (a lot of extra capacity is taken), yet is efficient from an I/O perspective.Erasure Coding helps S3 find a middle balance, by not taking too much extra capacity for the durability needs (they aren&#x2019;t replicating the data 3x) while still providing flexible I/O opportunity and surviving the same number of disk failures.</p><h1 id="sharding">Sharding</h1><p>S3 tries to spread these shards as broadly as they can. They&#x2019;ve shared that they have tens of thousands of customers with data stored over a million physical drives.</p><p>Spreading the data around gives them the following benefits:</p><p><strong>1. Hot Spot Aversion</strong><br>When the data is well spread out, no single customer can cause a hot spot that affects the system. Hot spots are particularly troublesome and worth avoiding, as they introduce cascading delays throughout the system and in the worst case can result in unpleasant domino effects.</p><p><strong>2. Burst Demand</strong><br>Similarly, the extra parallelism afforded by each drive the shards are on can allow for greater burst IO compared to what a naive solution may bring. (e.g the data replicated on 3 drives)</p><p><strong>3. Greater Durability</strong><br>The more the shards are spread, the greater the durability. You can sustain more individual machine failures.</p><p><strong>4. No Read Amplification</strong><br>Read amplification denotes how many disk seeks a single read causes.Assuming homogeneous hardware, a single read will still cause roughly the same amount of disk seeks. But since the data is spread around, those seeks will <strong>not</strong> be on the same drive.</p><p>The less disk seeks one HDD needs to do, the better. This reduces the likelihood of high latency.</p><h1 id="heat-management-at-scale">Heat Management at Scale</h1><p>Given the scale, one of S3&#x2019;s biggest technical problems is managing and balancing this I/O demand across the large set of hard drives.</p><p>The overall goal is to minimize the number of requests that hit the same disk at any point in time. Otherwise, as we mentioned -&#xA0; you garner hot spots and accumulate tail latency that eventually grows to impact the overall request latency.</p><p>In the worst case, a disproportionate number of requests on the same drive can cause stalling as the limited I/O the disk provides becomes exhausted. This results in overall poor performance on requests that depend on the drive(s). As you stall the requests, the delay gets amplified up through layers of the software stack - like Erasure Coding write requests for new data or metadata lookups.</p><p>The initial placement of data is key, yet also tricky to get right because S3 doesn&#x2019;t know when or how the data is going to be accessed at the time of writing.</p><p>The S3 team shares that due to the sheer scale of the system and its multi tenancy, this otherwise hard problem becomes fundamentally easier.</p><p>S3 experiences so-called <strong>workload decorrelation</strong>. That is the phenomenon of seeing a smoothening of load once it&#x2019;s aggregated on a large enough scale.</p><p>The team shares that most storage workloads remain completely idle for most of the time. They only experience a sudden load peak when the data is accessed, and that peak demand is much higher than the mean.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TraiYIUBRNyTkyA4QsxctN9WqNsaA7xhYy7k_DrUfbLRYFTs91rDmQfCq1suM9ZXMqfVbt0w_pwTbYMgqGNE7ofbItA44GhIXendkmijCfAKJQatpFpY5XBOwQn69A4kI7_UBURp8BswhBXY2V2lJPk" class="kg-image" alt="Behind AWS S3&#x2019;s Massive Scale" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="889"></figure><p>But as the system aggregates millions of workloads, the underlying traffic to the storage flattens out remarkably. The aggregate demand results in a smoothened out, more predictable throughput.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1elXd4tCuwnNEnYN5QSLh3Df01ve6PdXchL4zq0euWeG9jDUHykkqdnwXXB7IlB5HdTfvRW1hy6AUyjdYKkDxtTieVKxFG7LkW9tRBlqTBAo0uuol7_vhRRgvfDorsCypR0jyW3pwLVnVdcAF6VK1IQ" class="kg-image" alt="Behind AWS S3&#x2019;s Massive Scale" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>When you aggregate on a large enough scale, a single workload cannot influence the aggregate peak.</p><p>The problem then becomes much easier to solve - you simply need to balance out a smooth demand rate across many disks.</p><h1 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h1><p>Parallelism has aligned incentives for both AWS and its customers - it unlocks better performance for the customers and allows S3 to optimize for workload decorrelation.</p><p>Let us take some numbers as examples:</p><h3 id="two-opposite-examples">Two Opposite Examples</h3><p>Imagine a 3.7 Petabyte S3 bucket. Say it takes in 2.3 million IOs a second.</p><p>With 26 TB disks, you&#x2019;d only need 143 drives to support the 3.7PB capacity.<br>But with the low 120 IOPS per disk, you&#x2019;d need 19,166 drives for the 2.3m IO demand! That&#x2019;s 13,302% more drives.</p><p>Now imagine the opposite - a 28PB S3 bucket with just 8,500 IOs a second.</p><p>With 120 IOPS per disk, you&#x2019;d need 71 drives for the IOs.&#xA0;<br>With 26TB disks, you&#x2019;d need <strong>1076</strong> drives for the capacity. That&#x2019;s 1,415% more drives.</p><p>A 134x imbalance in one case, 15x in another.</p><p>S3 likely has both types of workloads, but the large drive requirement proves the need of parallelism to achieve the necessary read throughput.</p><h2 id="parallelism-in-practice">Parallelism in Practice</h2><p>S3 leverages parallelism in two ways:</p><h3 id="across-servers"><strong>Across Servers</strong></h3><p>Parallelism begins at the clients!</p><p>Instead of requesting all the files through one client with one connection to one S3 endpoint, users are encouraged to create as many powers as possible with as many parallel connections as possible. This utilizes many different endpoints of the distributed system, ensuring no single point in the infrastructure becomes too hot (e.g caches)</p><h4 id="intra-operation">Intra-Operation</h4><p>Within a single operation inside a connection, S3 also leverages parallelism.</p><ul><li>PUT requests support multipart upload, which AWS recommends in order to maximize throughput by leveraging multiple threads.</li><li>GET requests similarly support an HTTP header denoting you read only a particular range of the object. AWS again recommends this for achieving higher aggregate throughput instead of the single object read request.</li></ul><h1 id="metadata-and-the-move-to-strong-consistency">Metadata and the Move to Strong Consistency</h1><p>In 2020, S3 introduced strong read-after-write consistency. Meaning that once you write a new object or overwrite an existing one, any subsequent read will receive the latest version of the object.</p><p>This was a massive change given the scale S3 was operating on, especially considering it came with zero impact to performance, availability or cost.</p><p>S3 has a discrete subsystem for storing <strong>per-object</strong> metadata. Because the metadata write/read is part of the critical data path for most requests, the system&#x2019;s persistence tier was designed to use a highly resilient caching technology ensuring that even if it was impaired, S3 requests would succeed.</p><p>This meant that writes might flow through one part of the cache infrastructure while reads might query another part, resulting in a stale read. It is said this was the main source of S3&#x2019;s eventual consistency.</p><p>As part of other features, S3 introduced new replication logic into its persistence tier that allowed them to reason about the <strong>per-object</strong> order of operations. As a core piece of their cache coherency protocol, this allowed them to understand if a cache&#x2019;s view of an object is stale.</p><p>A new component was introduced that would track this. Said component acts as a <a href="https://www2.cs.uh.edu/~paris/MYPAPERS/Icdcs86.pdf?ref=highscalability.com"><u>witness</u></a> to S3 writes and a read barrier during S3 reads. When the component recognizes that a value may be stale, it is invalidated from the cache and read from the persistence layer.</p><h1 id="durability"><strong>Durability</strong></h1><p>S3 offers 11 nines of durability - 99,999999999. The expected average annual loss is therefore 0.000000001% of objects stored.</p><p>Said simply, if you store 10,000 objects in S3, you can expect to lose a single object once every 10,000,000 years.</p><h2 id="hardware-failure">Hardware Failure</h2><p>Achieving 11 nines of durability is a difficult feat. Hard drives frequently fail and at S3&#x2019;s scale, it&#x2019;s likely an hourly occurrence.</p><p>In theory - durability is simple. As hard drives fail, you repair them. As long as the repair rate matches the failure rate, your data is safe.</p><p>In practice - to ensure this process is reliable in the face of unpredictable failures, you need to build a system around it.</p><p>AWS shared a simple real-world example where failures accumulate - imagine the data center is in a hot climate and a power outage occurs. Its cooling system stops working. Disks begin to overheat and the failure rate goes up significantly.</p><p>AWS built a continuous self-healing system with detectors that track the failures and scale their repair fleet accordingly.</p><p>In the background, a durability model runs analysis to track whether the desired durability is actually met.</p><p>The lesson here is that durability cannot be a single snapshot of the system - it is a continuous evaluation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/U4rnWL8UGkZV72NH38hrlqQnJ0CmVaf1U0CJr8dDrrDz2n451o8O-Uq9VJT0Yheq5Y0nF-EHO7jp1hXFkLliV9G73-8UlizKjHyN6LMxRN074j16Kk-voRYgijMI3Rq8iZgsvYcCjJN4PF7fmgjYae0" class="kg-image" alt="Behind AWS S3&#x2019;s Massive Scale" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1037"></figure><h2 id="other-failures">Other Failures</h2><p>Durability is a large umbrella.

Bursty workloads that store a lot of data, stay idle for months and then read everything in a short burst, like genomics, machine learning and self-driving cars, can use S3 without the need to pay the full price of all the drives they need if they had to deploy it themselves. It&#x2019;s an interesting case study of how scale unlocks cost-effectiveness and makes management easier.</p><h1 id="resources">Resources</h1><p>This blog post was formed by a collection of public resources AWS have shared regarding S3.

If you&#x2019;re unfamiliar with this story, Swedbank had a major outage in April 2022 that was caused by an unapproved change to their IT systems. It temporarily left nearly a million customers with incorrect balances, many of whom were unable to meet payments.</p><p>After investigation, the regulator found that Swedbank had not followed their change management process and issued a SEK850M (~85M USD) fine. That&#x2019;s a lot of money to you and me, but probably didn&#x2019;t impact their bottom line very much. Either way I&#x2019;m sure the whole episode will have been a big wake up call for the people at the bank whose job it is to ensure adequate risk and change controls. So, what went wrong and how could it have been avoided?</p><h2 id="how-did-the-swedbank-incident-happen">How did the Swedbank incident happen?</h2><p>The judgment doesn&#x2019;t describe the technical details behind the incident, but it does provide glimpses into how they assessed what went wrong:</p><ul><li>&#x201C;The deficiencies that were present in Swedbank&#x2019;s internal control made it possible to make changes to one of the bank&#x2019;s most central IT systems without following the process in place at the bank to ensure continuity and reliable operations. This violation is therefore neither minor nor excusable.&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;none of the bank&#x2019;s control mechanisms were able to capture the deviation and ensure that the process was followed&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;one of the main causes underlying the IT incident was non-compliance with the change management process and that it is probable that this also resulted in a slower analysis of the incident and a greater impact on the operations.&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;good internal control is a prerequisite for a bank to be able to fulfill the requirements on risk management&#x201D;</li></ul><p>Even if you think $85M isn&#x2019;t much of a fine - simply the cost of doing business - the full range of options open to the regulator included removing Swedbank&#x2019;s banking license: &#xA0;&#x201C;It is therefore not relevant to withdraw Swedbank&#x2019;s authorisation or issue the bank a warning. The sanction should instead be limited to a remark and an administrative fine.&#x201D; Gulp.</p><h2 id="change-management-doesn-t-mitigate-risk">Change management doesn&#x2019;t mitigate risk</h2><p>What really interests me about cases like this is that, even when followed to the letter, the old ways of managing change with manual approvals and change meetings do not mitigate risk in today&#x2019;s technology organizations. These processes don&#x2019;t work because complying with them is no guarantee that changes are being made safely and securely.</p><p>Tell me if you&#x2019;ve heard this one before?</p><ul><li>Bank has a major IT outage/incident</li><li>A change was applied without following change management process</li><li>Bank claims the risk controls work if they are followed</li><li>Regulator fines bank for not following process + having insufficient controls</li><li>Bank adds more change controls</li></ul><p>The position of the regulator constitutes self-referential logic. You said you&#x2019;d do something to manage risk, it wasn&#x2019;t done, therefore you are in violation. But, is change management the best way to manage IT risk?</p><h2 id="what-the-uk-fca-says-about-change">What the UK FCA says about change</h2><p><a href="https://www.kosli.com/blog/what-the-fca-found-when-analysing-1-million-production-changes/?ref=highscalability.com">I&#x2019;ve written previously</a> on some <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/implementing-technology-change?ref=highscalability.com">fantastic research published by the Financial Conduct Authority</a> in the UK. They took a data-driven approach to understand the workings of change management processes, which uncovered some provocative findings:</p><p>&#x201C;One of the key assurance controls firms used when implementing major changes was the Change Advisory Board (CAB). However, we found that CABs approved over 90% of the major changes they reviewed, and in some firms the CAB had not rejected a single change during 2019. This raises questions over the effectiveness of CABs as an assurance mechanism.&#x201D;</p><p>Change as a control gate doesn&#x2019;t work, but everyone does it. Why? To avoid $85MUSD fines. In the UK and USA these can be issued to individuals as well as organizations. So, if you have followed the process, at the very least you are compliant and not liable for heavy financial penalties. It&#x2019;s also about covering your back - &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not my fault, I ticked all the boxes.&#x201D; But is the bank safe though? Are the systems themselves secure?</p><p>Change management gathers documentation of process conformance, but it doesn&#x2019;t reduce risk in the way that you&#x2019;d think. It reduces the risk of undocumented changes, but risks in changes that are fully documented can sail through the approval process unnoticed. This is an important and quite shocking finding: adherence to traditional change management doesn&#x2019;t work to manage the risk of changes.</p><h2 id="research-shows-external-approvals-don-t-work">Research shows external approvals don&#x2019;t work</h2><p>The science of DevOps backs this up. Here&#x2019;s the unvarnished truth on external approvals and CABs based on research by Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim in their 2018 book, Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations.</p><p><em>&#x201C;We found that external approvals were negatively correlated with lead time, deployment frequency, and restore time, and had no correlation with change fail rate. In short, approval by an external body (such as a change manager or CAB) simply doesn&#x2019;t work to increase the stability of production systems, measured by the time to restore service and change fail rate. However, it certainly slows things down. It is, in fact, worse than having no change approval process at all.&#x201D;</em></p><p>Worse than no change approval process at all. So, if you want to avoid fines, cover your back AND reduce the likelihood of production incidents, what would you do?</p><h2 id="change-is-not-the-problem-it-s-unaddressed-risk">Change is not the problem. It&#x2019;s unaddressed risk</h2><p>If change is not the problem, then what is?</p><p>What would work? Well the FCA has some insights on this:</p><p>&#x201C;Frequent releases and agile delivery can help firms to reduce the likelihood and impact of change related incidents:</p><p>Overall, we found that firms that deployed smaller, more frequent releases had higher change success rates than those with longer release cycles. Firms that made effective use of agile delivery methodologies were also less likely to experience a change incident.&#x201D;</p><p>In short - paperwork doesn&#x2019;t reduce risk. &#xA0;Less risky changes reduce risk. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m going out on a limb here, but if Swedbank had in fact followed processes and still had the outage, I believe Finansinspektionen (the Swedish FCA) would still have given a fine, but for insufficient risk management.</p><h2 id="story-time-streams-feeding-the-lake">Story time: streams feeding the lake</h2><p>We can think of software changes as streams, feeding into our environments which are lakes. &#xA0;Change management puts a gate in the stream to control what flows into the lake, but doesn&#x2019;t monitor the lake.</p><p>If it is possible to make a change to production without detection, then change management only protects one source of risk. The only way to be sure you don&#x2019;t have undocumented production changes is with runtime monitoring.</p><p>For me what is really interesting about this story is the echoes and parallels it has with the Knight Capital incident <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf?ref=highscalability.com">so well documented by the SEC</a>. In both cases, an incomplete understanding of how changes have been applied to production systems due to insufficient observability and traceability prolonged and amplified the scale of the outages.</p><p>And leaves an open question: how many similar changes have been made that didn&#x2019;t cause an outage? &#xA0;Without monitoring it is really hard to know.</p><h2 id="if-change-management-doesn-t-work-why-do-we-do-it">If change management doesn&#x2019;t work, why do we do it?</h2><p>It all goes back to software history. Traditionally changes were rare, big and risky. &#xA0;It was the annual upgrade, or the monthly patch. Because these big batches of change were risky, companies introduced long testing and qualification processes, change management, service windows, and a large number of checklists to help mitigate the risks and test-in quality.</p><p>Before we had modern practices of test automation, continuous delivery, DevSecOps, rolling deployments with fast rollback, this was the only way. The trouble is, the financial services industry is packed full of legacy systems and outsourcing where implementing these practices is technically challenging and uneconomic.</p><p>Maybe it is time we acknowledge legacy software, risk management, and outsourcing are a major systemic risk in the financial sector?</p><p>The flipside is also true. Many next generation systems in financial services are so dynamic and distributed that it is really hard to get a handle on the volume of changes occurring.</p><h2 id="risk-management-that-works">Risk management that works</h2><p>The only way to not get burned is to avoid playing with fire. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto?ref=highscalability.com">Checklists</a> can help, but if you have a lot of IT risk the only way to really reduce it is to do the technical work to make changes less risky, and move to smaller, more frequent changes. And you can reduce this toil by automating change controls and documentation, and introducing monitoring and alerting systems to detect unauthorized changes.

class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Figure 1: Process workflow for pushing new versions of Presto (Diagram by Philip S. Bell)</p><p>Meta runs a large number of Presto clusters spanning data centers across locations worldwide. A new version of Presto is built and ready for deployment roughly at least once, and sometimes twice, each month. One of the earliest challenges we faced as Presto&#x2019;s footprint at Meta grew rapidly was deploying the query engine to a high volume of clusters while ensuring consistent availability and reliability. This continues to be especially true for interactive use cases of Presto, i.e., when a user launches a query and is actively waiting for a result. Query failure is less of a concern for automated &#x201C;batch&#x201D; use cases where automatic retries ensure that the query eventually succeeds.</p><p>The solution for this was simple. All Presto clusters sit behind a load balancer called the Gateway which is responsible (in conjunction with other systems at Meta) for routing Presto queries to the appropriate cluster. When a Presto cluster needs to be updated, it is first marked as drained from the Gateway, i.e., the Gateway stops routing any new queries to it. Automation then waits for a predetermined time in order for queries currently running on the cluster to finish. The cluster is then updated, and once online, it is made visible to the Gateway, which can start routing new queries to it.</p><p>The other aspect to deploying new Presto releases is availability. We need to ensure that users can still use Presto while clusters are getting updated. Again, automation ensures that every data center in every physical region always has the necessary number of Presto clusters available. Of course, a balance has to be struck between taking down too many clusters at once (availability issue) and taking down too few at once (deployment takes too long).</p><h2

class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Figure 2: Automated workflow for adding hardware to clusters (Diagram by Philip S. Bell)</p><p>The distribution of the data warehouse at Meta across different regions is constantly evolving. This means new Presto clusters must be stood up while existing ones are decommissioned regularly. Previously, when there was only a small number of Presto clusters, this was a manual process. As Meta started scaling up, it quickly became challenging to track all changes manually. To solve this problem, we implemented automations to handle the standing up and decommissioning of clusters.</p><p>First we had to standardize our cluster configurations, i.e., we had to build base configurations for the different Presto use cases at Meta. Each cluster would then have a minimal number of additional or overridden specifications over the base configuration. Once that was complete, any new cluster could be turned up by automatically generating configs from the base template. Cluster turnup also required integration with automation hooks in order to integrate with the various company-wide infrastructure services like Tupperware and data warehouse-specific services. Once a cluster comes online, a few test queries are sent to the cluster and automation verifies that the queries were successfully executed by the cluster. The cluster is then registered with the Gateway and starts serving queries.</p><p>Decommissioning a cluster follows pretty much the reverse process. The cluster is de-registered from the Gateway and any running queries are allowed to finish. The Presto processes are shut down and the cluster configs are deleted.</p><p>This automation is integrated into the hardware stand up and decommission workflow for the data warehouse. The end result is that the entire process, from new hardware showing up at a data center, to Presto clusters being online and serving queries, then being shut off when hardware is decommissioned, is fully automated.

class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Figure 3: Bad host detection (Diagram by Philip S. Bell)</p><p>Given the large deployment of Presto at Meta, it&#x2019;s imperative that we have tooling and automation in place that makes the life of the oncall (the point of contact for Presto) easy.</p><p>Over the years, we&#x2019;ve built several &#x201C;analyzers&#x201D; which help the oncall efficiently debug and assess the root cause for issues that come up. Monitoring systems fire alerts when there are breaches of customer-facing SLAs. The analyzers are then triggered. They source information from a wide range of monitoring systems (Operational Data Store or ODS), events published to Scuba, and even host-level logs. Custom logic in the analyzer then ties all this information together to infer probable root cause. This is extremely useful for the oncall by presenting them with root cause analysis and allowing them to jump directly into potential mitigation options. In some cases, we have completely automated both the debugging and the remediation so that the oncall doesn&#x2019;t even need to get involved. A couple of examples are described below:</p><h2 id="bad-host-detection">Bad host detection</h2><p>When running Presto at scale on a large number of machines, we noticed that certain &#x201C;bad&#x201D; hosts could cause excessive query failures. Following our investigations, we identified a few root causes which resulted in the hosts going &#x201C;bad&#x201D;, including:</p><p>Hardware-level issues which hadn&#x2019;t yet been caught by fleet-wide monitoring systems due to lack of coverage</p><p>Obscure JVM bugs which would sometimes lead to a steady drip of query failures</p><p>To combat this issue, we now monitor query failures in Presto clusters. Specifically, we attribute each query failure to the host that caused it, where possible. We also set up alerts that fire when an abnormally high number of query failures are attributed to specific hosts. Automation then kicks in to drain the host from the Presto fleet and thus stem the failures.</p><h2 id="debugging-queueing-issues">Debugging queueing issues</h2><p>Each Presto cluster supports queuing queries on it once it reaches its maximum concurrency for running queries based on use case, hardware configuration, and query size. At Meta, there is a sophisticated routing mechanism in place so that a Presto query is dispatched to the &#x201C;right&#x201D; cluster which can execute the query while making the best use of resources. Several systems beyond Presto are involved in making the routing decision and they take multiple factors into account:</p><p>Current state of queuing on Presto clusters</p><p>Distribution of hardware across different datacenters</p><p>The data locality of the tables that the query uses</p><p>Given this complexity, it can be very hard for an oncall to figure out the root cause of any queueing problems encountered in production. This is another instance where analyzers come to the fore by pulling information from multiple sources and presenting conclusions.</p><h2 id="load-balancer-robustness">Load balancer robustness</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oQmIbyh-d-3r2AkFguXlLnziGfVpctg-Uv920Rx3C_xy-hI-6JaBW9yDc5lh0FCWjzcXkUyspgw6FLTsSiyU3HgWnBjlmuQ_auWC2F1_xqfJQ371vRV1sKjlMoCROw1BElpiWDaFi_YF-Q2V0wIELZE" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="595" height="249"></figure><p>Figure 4: Load balancer robustness (Diagram by Philip S. Bell)</p><p>As mentioned above, our Presto clusters sit behind load balancers which route every single Presto query at Meta. In the beginning, when Presto had not yet scaled up the level of internal usage it has today, the Gateway was very simple. However, as usage of Presto increased across Meta, we ran into scalability issues on a couple of occasions. One of them was the Gateway failing under heavy load, which could lead to Presto being unavailable for all users. The root cause for some stability issues was one service unintentionally bombarding the Gateway with millions of queries in a short span, resulting in the Gateway processes crashing and unable to route any queries.</p><p>To prevent such a scenario, we set about making the Gateway more robust and tolerant to such unintended DDoS-style traffic. We implemented a throttling feature, which rejects queries when under heavy load. The throttling can be activated based on query count per second across various dimensions like per user, per source, per IP, and also at a global level for all queries. Another enhancement we implemented was autoscaling. Leaning on a Meta-wide service that supports scaling up and down of jobs, the number of Gateway instances are now dynamic. This means that under heavy load, the Gateway can now scale up to handle the additional traffic and not be maxed out on CPU/memory, thus preventing the crashing scenario described above. This, in conjunction with the throttling feature, ensures that the Gateway is robust and can withstand adverse unpredictable traffic patterns.</p><h1 id="what-advice-would-we-give-a-team-scaling-up-their-own-data-lakehouse-using-presto">What advice would we give a team scaling up their own Data Lakehouse using Presto?</h1><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kVHMqIxQ6_y0BNVUrY8fLIyS4ZR61WD1POCDX4lhEyUT3ERxVLZ_l8-dS_qZgzoMC4A4G27valSsTNPdMIm6x-LoqwEY4BpDnPfLLsr9u4KItet_0lChBTnF2QRbRz9acQi131_uAR5m988bkvX3mEs" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="637" height="243"></figure><p>Figure 5: Presto architecture scaling (Diagram by Philip S. Bell)</p><p>Some of the important aspects to be kept in mind when scaling up Presto are:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Establishing easy-to-understand and well-defined customer-facing SLAs.</span><span> Defining SLAs around important metrics like queueing time and query failure rate in a manner that tracks customer pain points becomes crucial as Presto is scaled up. When there is a large number of users, the lack of proper SLAs can greatly hinder efforts to mitigate production issues because of confusion in determining the impact of an incident.&#xA0;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Monitoring and automated debugging. </span><span>As Presto is scaled up and the number of clusters increases, monitoring and automated debugging becomes critical.&#xA0;</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Having thorough monitoring can help identify production issues before their blast radius becomes too big. Catching issues early will ensure we&#x2019;re minimizing user impact where we can.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Manual investigations in the face of customer-impacting production issues are not scalable. It&#x2019;s imperative to have automated debugging in place so that the root cause can be quickly determined.</span></p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Good load balancing. </span><span>As the Presto fleet grows, it&#x2019;s important to have a good load balancing solution sitting in front of the Presto clusters. At scale, small inefficiencies in load balancing can have an outsized negative impact due to the sheer volume of the workload.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Configuration management. </span><span>Configuration management of a large fleet of Presto clusters can become a pain if it&#x2019;s not well planned for. Where possible, configurations should be made hot reloadable so that Presto instances do not have to be restarted or updated in a disruptive manner which will result in query failures and customer dissatisfaction.</span></p>

Although this approach provides a strong consistency guarantee, the primary drawbacks are the state management service becomes a single point of failure and runs into scalability problems for a large distributed system [1], [11].</p><h3 id="peer-to-peer-state-management-service">Peer-To-Peer State Management Service</h3><p>The peer-to-peer state management approach is inclined towards high availability and eventual consistency. The gossip protocol algorithms can be used to implement peer-to-peer state management services with high scalability and improved resilience [1].</p><p>The gossip protocol is also known as the <strong>epidemic protocol </strong>because<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>transmission of the messages is similar to the way how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">epidemics</a> spread. The concept of communication in gossip protocol is analogous to the spread of rumors among the office staff or the dissemination of information on a social media website [4], [8].</p><h2 id="broadcast-protocols">Broadcast Protocols</h2><p>The popular message broadcasting techniques in a distributed system are the following:</p><ul><li>point-to-point broadcast</li><li>eager reliable broadcast</li><li>gossip protocol</li></ul><h3 id="point-to-point-broadcast">Point-To-Point Broadcast</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://highscalability.com/content/images/2024/02/ege6ztj-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515329345.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="752" height="413" srcset="https://highscalability.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/ege6ztj-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515329345.png 600w, https://highscalability.com/content/images/2024/02/ege6ztj-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515329345.png 752w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The producer sends a message directly to the consumers in a point-to-point broadcast. The retry mechanism on the producer and deduplication mechanism on the consumers makes the point-to-point broadcast reliable. The messages will be lost when the producer and the consumer fail simultaneously [3].</p><h4 id="eager-reliable-broadcast"><strong>Eager Reliable Broadcast</strong></h4><p>Every node re-broadcasts the messages to every other node via reliable network links. This approach provides improved fault tolerance because messages are not lost when both the producer and the consumer fail simultaneously. The message will be re-broadcast by the remaining nodes. The caveats of eager reliable broadcast are the following [3], [8]:</p><ul><li>significant network bandwidth usage due to O(n&#xB2;) messages being broadcast for <em>n</em> number of nodes</li><li>sending node can become a bottleneck due to O(n) linear broadcast</li><li>every node stores the list of all the nodes in the system causing increased storage costs</li></ul><h3 id="gossip-protocol">Gossip Protocol</h3><p>The gossip protocol is a decentralized peer-to-peer communication technique to transmit messages in an enormous distributed system [1], [8]. The key concept of gossip protocol is that every node periodically sends out a message to a subset of other random nodes [8], [2]. The entire system will receive the particular message eventually with a high probability [11], [3]. In layman&#x2019;s terms, the gossip protocol is a technique for nodes to build a global map through limited local interactions [1].</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://highscalability.com/content/images/2024/02/1nu8hxn-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515298461.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="685" height="377" srcset="https://highscalability.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/1nu8hxn-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515298461.gif 600w, https://highscalability.com/content/images/2024/02/1nu8hxn-__squarespace_cacheversion-1689515298461.gif 685w"></figure><p>The gossip protocol is built on a robust, scalable, and eventually consistent  algorithm. The gossip protocol is typically used to maintain the node membership list, achieve consensus, and  fault detection in a distributed system [2]. In addition, additional information such as application-level data can be piggybacked on gossip messages [1].</p><p>The gossip protocol is reliable because a node failure can be overcome by the retransmission of a message by another node. First-in-first-out (<strong>FIFO</strong>) broadcast, causality broadcast, and total order broadcast can be implemented with gossip protocol [3].</p><p>The gossip protocol parameters such as cycle and fanout can be tuned to improve the probabilistic guarantees of the gossip protocol. The following tools offer a high-end simulation and visualization of the gossip protocol [8], [5]:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/simulator.html?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">serf convergence simulator</a></li><li><a href="https://flopezluis.github.io/gossip-simulator/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">gossip simulator</a></li></ul><p>The following characteristics of the gossip protocol make it an optimal choice as the communication protocol in a large-scale distributed system [12]:</p><ul><li>limits the number of messages transmitted by each node</li><li>limits the bandwidth consumption to prevent the degradation of application performance</li><li>tolerates network and node failures</li></ul><p>The gossip protocol can be used to keep nodes consistent only when the operations executed are commutative and serializability is not necessary. The <strong>tombstone</strong> is a special entry to invalidate the data entries that have a matching key without actual deletion of the data. The gossip protocol deletes the data from a node using a tombstone.</p><h2 id="types-of-gossip-protocol">Types of Gossip Protocol</h2><p>The time required by the gossip protocol to propagate a message across the system and the network traffic generated in propagating a message must be taken into consideration while choosing the type of gossip protocol for a particular use case [10]. The gossip protocol can be broadly categorized into the following types [8], [10]:</p><ul><li>anti-entropy model</li><li>rumor-mongering model</li><li>aggregation model</li></ul><h3 id="anti-entropy-gossip-protocol"><strong>Anti-Entropy Gossip Protocol</strong></h3><p>The anti-entropy algorithm was introduced to reduce the entropy between replicas of a stateful service such as the database. The replicated data is compared and the difference between replicas are patched [10]. The node with the newest message shares it with other nodes in every gossip round [8].</p><p>The anti-entropy model usually transfers the whole dataset resulting in unnecessary bandwidth usage. The techniques such as checksum, recent update list, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Merkle tree</a> can be used to identify the differences between nodes to avoid transmission of the entire dataset and reduce network bandwidth usage. The anti-entropy gossip protocol will send an unbounded number of messages without termination [8].</p><h3 id="rumor-mongering-gossip-protocol"><strong>Rumor-Mongering Gossip Protocol</strong></h3><p>The rumor-mongering protocol is also known as the <strong>dissemination protocol</strong>. The rumor-mongering cycle occurs relatively more frequently than anti-entropy cycles and floods the network with the worst-case load [10]. The rumor-mongering model utilizes fewer resources such as network bandwidth as only the latest updates are transferred across nodes [8].</p><p>A message will be marked as removed after a few rounds of communication to limit the number of messages. There is usually a high probability that a message will reach all the nodes [8].</p><h3 id="aggregation-gossip-protocol"><strong>Aggregation Gossip Protocol</strong></h3><p>The aggregation gossip protocol computes a system-wide aggregate by sampling information across every node and combining the values to generate a system-wide value [10].</p><h2 id="further-system-design-learning-resources">Further system design learning resources</h2><p><a href="https://systemdesignone.substack.com/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener noreffer "><strong>Subscribe to the system design newsletter</strong></a> and never miss a new blog post again.

The strategy to spread a message through gossip protocol should be chosen based on the service requirements and available network conditions. There are tradeoffs in terms of bandwidth, latency, and reliability with each strategy to spread a message. The strategies to spread a message apply to both anti-entropy and rumor-mongering models. The different strategies to spread a message with the gossip protocol are as follows [8], [5], [2]:</p><ul><li>push model</li><li>pull model</li><li>push-pull model</li></ul><p><strong>Push Model</strong></p><p>The push model is efficient when there are only a few update messages due to the traffic overhead. The node with the latest message sends the message to a random subset of other nodes in the push model [8].</p><p><strong>Pull Model</strong></p><p>Every node will actively poll a random subset of nodes for any update messages in the pull model. This approach is efficient when there are many update messages because it is highly likely to find a node with the latest update message [8].</p><p><strong>Push-Pull Model</strong></p><p>The push-pull model is optimal to disseminate update messages quickly and reliably [2]. The node can push a new update message and the node can also poll for new update messages. The push approach is efficient during the initial phase when there are only a very few nodes with update messages. The pull approach is efficient during the final phase when there are numerous nodes with many update messages [8].</p><h2 id="gossip-protocol-performance">Gossip Protocol Performance</h2><p>The number of nodes that will receive the message from a particular node is known as the <strong>fanout</strong>. The count of gossip rounds required to spread a message across the entire cluster is known as the <strong>cycle </strong>[8], [5].</p><blockquote>cycles necessary to spread a message across the cluster = O(log n) to the base of fanout, where n = total number of nodes</blockquote><p>For instance, it takes approximately 15 gossip rounds to propagate a message across 25,000 nodes. The gossip interval can be set to a value as low as 10 ms to propagate a message across a big data center in roughly 3 seconds. The propagation of a message in the gossip protocol should automatically age out to reduce the unnecessary load [4]. The performance of a gossip protocol implementation can be measured with the following metrics [8]:</p><ul><li>residue: number of remaining nodes that haven&#x2019;t received the messages should be minimum</li><li>traffic: average number of messages sent between nodes should be minimum</li><li>convergence: every node should receive the message as quickly as possible</li><li>time average: average time taken to send the message to every node should be low</li><li>time last: the time taken for the last node to receive the message should be low</li></ul><p>A case study showed that a system with 128 nodes consumed less than 2 percent of CPU and less than 60 KBps of bandwidth to run gossip protocol [11].</p><h3 id="gossip-protocol-properties">Gossip Protocol Properties</h3><p>There is no formal way to define gossip protocol. In general, the gossip protocol is expected to satisfy the following properties [8]:</p><ul><li>node selection must be random to perform a fanout</li><li>only local information is available to every node and the nodes are oblivious to the state of the cluster</li><li>communication between nodes involves periodic, pairwise, interprocess interactions</li><li>bounded size transmission capacity per gossip round</li><li>every node deploys the same gossip protocol</li><li>unreliable network paths between nodes are assumed</li><li>node interaction frequency is low</li><li>node interactions result in a state exchange</li></ul><h3 id="gossip-algorithm">Gossip Algorithm</h3><p>The high-level overview of the gossip algorithm is the following [6], [1]:</p><ol><li>every node maintains a list of the subset of nodes and their metadata</li><li>gossip to a random live peer node&#x2019;s endpoint periodically</li><li>every node inspects the received gossip message to merge the highest version number to the local dataset</li></ol><p>The heartbeat counter of a node is incremented whenever a particular node participates in the gossip exchange. The node is labeled healthy when the heartbeat counter keeps incrementing. On the other hand, the node is considered to be unhealthy when the heartbeat counter has not changed for an extended period due to a network partition or node failure [1]. The following are the different criteria for peer node selection in the gossip protocol [12]:</p><ul><li>utilize library offered by programming languages such as java.util.random</li><li>interact with the least contacted node</li><li>enforce <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TPDS.2006.85?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">network-topology-aware</a> interaction</li></ul><h3 id="gossip-protocol-implementation">Gossip Protocol Implementation</h3><p>The gossip protocol transports messages over User Datagram Protocol (<strong>UDP</strong>) or Transmission Control Protocol (<strong>TCP</strong>) with a configurable but fixed fanout and interval [12]. The <strong>peer sampling service</strong> is used by the gossip protocol to identify the peer nodes for gossip message exchange. The peer sampling service uses a randomized algorithm for the selection of a peer node. The application programming interface (<strong>API</strong>) of the peer sampling service should provide the following endpoints [8]:</p><ul><li>/gossip/init: returns the list of nodes known to a particular node at startup</li><li>/gossip/get-peer: returns the address (IP address and port number) of an independent peer node</li></ul><p>The workflow of the peer sampling service execution is as follows [8]:</p><ol><li>initialize every node with a partial view of the system (a list with the subset of nodes)</li><li>merge the node&#x2019;s view with the peer node&#x2019;s view on the gossip exchange</li></ol><p>Put another way, every node maintains a small local membership table with a partial view of the system and periodically refreshes the table through gossip messages. The gossip protocol can leverage probabilistic distribution for selecting a peer node to reduce duplicate message transmission to the same node [4].</p><p>The application state can be transferred as key-value pairs via the gossip protocol. The most recent value must be transferred when multiple changes are performed to the same key by a node. The API provided by the gossip protocol to orchestrate application state exchange is the following [6]:</p><ul><li>/gossip/on-join</li><li>/gossip/on-alive</li><li>/gossip/on-dead</li><li>/gossip/on-change</li></ul><p>The <strong>seed nodes</strong> are fully functional nodes that are based on static configuration. Every node in the system must be aware of the seed nodes. The gossip system interacts with the seed nodes to prevent logical divisions [4], [12]. The following is the high-level workflow when a node receives a gossip message with the node metadata of a peer node [12]:</p><ol><li>compares the incoming gossip message to identify the missing values on the local node&#x2019;s dataset</li><li>compare the incoming gossip message to identify the missing values on the peer node&#x2019;s dataset</li><li>higher version value is chosen when the node already contains the values present in the incoming gossip message</li><li>append the missing values in the local node&#x2019;s dataset</li><li>return the missing values on the peer node&#x2019;s dataset in the response</li><li>update the peer node&#x2019;s dataset with the received response</li></ol><p>It is typical to transfer the entire node metadata through the gossip protocol on a node startup. An in-memory version number can be maintained by each node to send only incremental updates of the node metadata through the gossip protocol.</p><p>The <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/generation.html?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">generation clock</a> is a monotonically increasing number indicating the generation of the server. The generation clock is incremented whenever the node restarts. The version number guarantees the ordering and versioning of the application state. The version number can only be incremented [6]. The generation clock can be used along with the version number to detect node metadata changes correctly on node restarts [12].</p><p>The <strong>gossiper timer</strong> is a component of the gossip protocol that will ensure every node eventually contains the crucial metadata about peer nodes, including the nodes that are behind a network partition. Every node includes a heartbeat associated with it. The heartbeat state consists of the generation and version number. The application state consists of key-value pairs representing the node state and a version number [6].</p><p>A node initiating a gossip exchange sends a <strong>gossip digest synchronization</strong> message that consists of a list of <strong>gossip digests</strong>. The gossip digest consists of an endpoint address, a generation number, and a version number. The gossip digest acknowledgment message consists of a gossip digest list and an endpoint state list. The sample schema for the gossip digest is the following [6]:EndPointState: 10.0.1.42<br>  HeartBeatState: generation: 1259904231, version: 761<br>  ApplicationState: &quot;average-load&quot;: 2.4, generation: 1659909691, version: 42<br>  ApplicationState: &quot;bootstrapping&quot;: pxLpassF9XD8Kymj, generation: 1259909615, version: 90</p><h3 id="gossip-protocol-use-cases">Gossip Protocol Use Cases</h3><p>The gossip protocol is used in a multitude of applications where eventual consistency is favored. The popular applications of the gossip protocol are as follows [8], [5], [4], [7], [12]:</p><ul><li>database replication</li><li>information dissemination</li><li>maintaining cluster membership</li><li>failure detection</li><li>generate aggregations (calculate average, maximum, sum)</li><li>generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">overlay networks</a></li><li>leader election</li></ul><p>The gossip protocol can be used to detect the failure of a node in a distributed system with high probability. The failure detection of nodes can save resources such as CPU, bandwidth, and  queue space. In a distributed system, it is not sufficient to assert a node failure when a single client cannot interact with the particular node because there might be an occurrence of network partition or client failure [1]. It can be concluded with certainty the failure of a particular node when several nodes (<strong>clients</strong>) confirm the liveness of the particular node through gossip protocol [4], [11].</p><p>The gossip protocol is significantly more reliable for data exchange and command and control than through TCP connections. The gossip protocol enables abstracting communication about node and subsystem properties out of the application logic [11]. The node statistics such as the average load and free memory can be transmitted in gossip messages to improve the local decision-making on fanout.</p><p>The subsystem information such as queue depth, key metadata such as configuration changes, and even request-response can be transmitted through the gossip protocol. The aggregation of node update messages via gossip protocol allows sending data in a single chunk instead of multiple small messages to reduce the communication overhead [11].</p><p>The messages can be routed across the cluster optimally by identifying the liveness of nodes [9]. The decision-making at the local node level without involving a centralized service is the key to scaling the gossip protocol [4], [11]. The messages can be versioned with a vector clock to ignore the older message versions by the node [9], [2]. The real-world use cases of the gossip protocol are the following [12], [8], [4], [9], [11]:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Apache Cassandra</a> employs the gossip protocol to maintain cluster membership, transfer node metadata (token assignment), repair unread data using Merkle trees, and node failure detection</li><li><a href="https://www.consul.io/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Consul</a> utilizes the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">swim-gossip</a> protocol variant for group membership, leader election, and failure detection of consul agents</li><li><a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">CockroachDB</a> operates the gossip protocol to propagate the node metadata</li><li><a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/gossip.html?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Fabric</a> blockchain uses the gossip protocol for group membership and ledger metadata transfer</li><li><a href="https://riak.com/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Riak</a> utilizes the gossip protocol to transmit <a href="https://systemdesign.one/consistent-hashing-explained/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">consistent hash ring</a> state and node metadata around the cluster</li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Amazon S3</a> uses the gossip protocol to spread server state across the system</li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Amazon Dynamo</a> employs the gossip protocol for failure detection, and keeping track of node membership</li><li><a href="https://redis.io/?ref=highscalability.com" rel="noopener">Redis</a> cluster uses the gossip protocol to propagate the node metadata</li><li>Bitcoin uses the gossip protocol to spread the nonce value across the mining nodes</li></ul><h3 id="gossip-protocol-advantages">Gossip Protocol Advantages</h3><p>The advantages of gossip protocol are the following [8], [2], [7], [4], [5]:</p><ul><li>scalable</li><li>fault tolerant</li><li>robust</li><li>convergent consistency</li><li>decentralized</li><li>simplicity</li><li>integration and interoperability</li><li>bounded load</li></ul><h4 id="scalability">Scalability</h4><p>Scalability is the ability of the system to handle the increasing load without degradation of the performance [2]. The gossip protocol cycle requires logarithmic time to achieve convergence. In addition, every node interacts with only a fixed number of nodes and sends only a fixed number of messages independent of the  number of nodes in the system. A node doesn&#x2019;t wait for an acknowledgment to improve latency [8], [4], [5].</p><h4 id="fault-tolerance">Fault Tolerance</h4><p>Fault tolerance is the ability of the system to remain functional in the occurrence of failures such as node crashes, network partitions, or message loss. The distributed system employing the gossip protocol is fault tolerant due to tolerance towards unreliable networks. The redundancy, parallelism, and randomness offered by the gossip protocol improve the fault tolerance of the system [2].</p><p>Furthermore, the symmetric and decentralized nature of the nodes strengthens the fault tolerance of the gossip protocol [5]. The same message is usually transmitted several times across multiple nodes. Put another way, there are many routes for the message flow between the source and destination. So, a node failure is overcome via message transmission through another node [8], [4].</p><h4 id="robustness">Robustness</h4><p>The symmetric nature of the nodes participating in the gossip protocol improves the robustness of the system [5], [4]. A node failure will not disrupt the system quality. The gossip protocol is also robust against transient network partitions. However, the gossip protocol is not robust against a malfunctioning node or a malicious gossip message unless the data is self-verified [8], [7].</p><p>A score-based reputation system for nodes can be used to prevent gossip system corruption by malicious nodes. Appropriate mechanisms and policies such as encryption, authentication, and authorization must be implemented to enforce the privacy and security of the gossip system [2].</p><h4 id="convergent-consistency"><strong>Convergent Consistency</strong></h4><p>Consistency is the technique of ensuring the same state view across every node in the system. The different consistency levels  such as strong, eventual, causal, and probabilistic consistency have different implications on the performance, availability, and correctness of the system [2]. The gossip protocol converges to a consistent state in logarithmic time complexity through the exponential spread of data [8], [5].</p><h4 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h4><p>The gossip protocol offers an extremely decentralized model of information discovery through peer-to-peer communication [8], [4], [5].</p><h4 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h4><p>Most variants of the gossip protocol can be implemented with very little code and low complexity [8], [5]. The symmetric nature of the nodes makes it trivial to execute the gossip protocol [7].</p><h4 id="integration-and-interoperability">Integration and Interoperability</h4><p>The gossip protocol can be integrated and interoperated with distributed system components such as the database, cache, and queue. Common interfaces, data formats, and protocols must be defined to implement the gossip protocol across different distributed system components [2].</p><h4 id="bounded-load">Bounded Load</h4><p>The classic distributed system protocols usually generate high surge loads that might overload individual distributed system components. The gossip protocol will produce only a strictly bounded worst-case load on individual distributed system components to avoid the disruption of service quality. The peer node selection in the gossip protocol can be tuned to reduce the load on network links. In practice, the load generated by the gossip protocol is not only bounded but also negligible compared to the available bandwidth [7].</p><h3 id="gossip-protocol-disadvantages">Gossip Protocol Disadvantages</h3><p>The disadvantages of the gossip protocol are the following [1], [5], [8], [2], [7]:</p><ul><li>eventual consistency</li><li>unawareness of network partitions</li><li>relatively high bandwidth consumption</li><li>increased latency</li><li>difficulty in debugging and testing</li><li>membership protocol is not scalable</li><li>prone to computational errors</li></ul><h4 id="eventually-consistent">Eventually Consistent</h4><p>The gossip protocol is inherently eventually consistent [1]. The gossip protocol is relatively slower compared to multicast [5]. There is also an overhead associated with gossip messages and the gossip behavior depends on the network topology and node heterogeneity [2]. Therefore, there will be some delay to recognize a new node or a node failure by the cluster [12].</p><h4 id="network-partition-unawareness">Network Partition Unawareness</h4><p>When a network partition occurs, the nodes in the sub-partition will still gossip with each other. Hence, the gossip protocol is unaware of network partitions and might significantly delay message propagation [1], [7].</p><h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4><p>The gossip protocol is not known for efficiency as the same message might be retransmitted to the same node multiple times consuming unnecessary bandwidth [5], [8]. Although the bandwidth usage by the gossip protocol is limited due to bounded message size and periodic exchange of messages, the effective fanout by gossip exchange might degrade when the amount of information that a node should gossip exceeds the bounded message size [7].</p><p>The saturation point of the gossip protocol depends on different parameters such as the rate of generation of messages, message size, fanout, and the type of gossip protocol [7], [8].</p><h4 id="latency">Latency</h4><p>The usage of the gossip protocol results in increased latency because the node must wait for the next gossip cycle (interval) to transmit the message [5].

I&apos;m happy to answer any questions you have. Please go ahead and ask your first question.</p><h2 id="explain-cloud-computing-to-me-at-a-professional-level">Explain cloud computing to me at a professional level?</h2><p>Cloud computing is a model of computing that delivers computing services over the internet, including storage, data processing, and networking. It allows users to access and use shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, on demand and without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. This model of computing has become increasingly popular in recent years, as it offers a number of benefits, including cost savings, flexibility, scalability, and increased efficiency. Additionally, cloud computing allows for greater collaboration and innovation, as it enables users to access and share data and resources from anywhere, at any time.</p><h2 id="can-you-expand">Can you expand?</h2><p>Certainly. Cloud computing has become a widely-used model of computing, as it offers a number of benefits over traditional, on-premises computing systems. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is its scalability, which allows users to easily and quickly scale up or down their use of computing resources, depending on their changing needs. This means that users only pay for the computing resources they actually use, rather than having to invest in expensive hardware and software upfront. This can result in significant cost savings, as well as increased flexibility and agility.</p><p>Another key benefit of cloud computing is its reliability and availability. Because cloud computing services are delivered over the internet, users can access their data and applications from anywhere, at any time. This means that they are not tied to a specific location, and can work remotely or on the go. Additionally, because cloud computing services are provided by large, established companies, they are typically highly reliable and available, with robust security and privacy measures in place to protect user data.</p><p>Finally, cloud computing enables greater collaboration and innovation. By allowing users to access and share data and resources from anywhere, at any time, cloud computing makes it easier for teams to work together and share ideas. This can facilitate greater collaboration and innovation, as it enables users to access the latest tools and technologies, and work together in real time to solve complex problems. Overall, cloud computing offers a number of benefits that make it an attractive option for businesses and individuals alike.</p><h2 id="which-cloud-provider-would-you-recommend">Which cloud provider would you recommend?</h2><p>I&apos;m sorry, but as a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don&apos;t have the ability to browse the internet or keep up-to-date with current events. I am not able to recommend specific cloud providers. Additionally, choosing a cloud provider is a complex decision that depends on a number of factors, including the specific needs and requirements of your organization. It&apos;s best to carefully evaluate the options and compare the different services and features offered by different providers before making a decision.</p><h2 id="do-you-think-hey-and-basecamp-should-leave-the-cloud-or-go-on-prem">Do you think HEY and Basecamp should leave the cloud or go on-prem?</h2><p>As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or keep up-to-date with current events. I am not familiar with the specific circumstances of HEY and Basecamp, and do not have enough information to make a recommendation on whether they should leave the cloud and go on-premises. As I mentioned earlier, choosing a computing model, whether it be cloud or on-premises, is a complex decision that depends on a number of factors, including the specific needs and requirements of your organization. It&apos;s best to carefully evaluate the options and compare the different services and features offered by different providers before making a decision.</p><h2 id="are-you-hosted-on-the-cloud">Are you hosted on the cloud?</h2><p>As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I exist purely as a software program and do not have a physical presence. I do not reside on any specific type of hardware or infrastructure, and am not hosted on the cloud or on-premises. I exist as a set of algorithms and data that enable me to process natural language input and generate responses based on that input. I am designed to be run on a variety of different hardware and software platforms, including mobile devices, desktop computers, and cloud-based servers.</p><h2 id="explain-serverless-to-me-at-a-professional-level">Explain serverless to me at a professional level.</h2><p>Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of computing resources, such as server and storage capacity, in response to the specific needs of the user. This means that the user does not need to worry about managing and scaling the underlying infrastructure, and only pays for the specific resources they use, such as the amount of data processed or the number of requests handled. Serverless computing is often used for applications that require scalable, on-demand computing resources, such as web and mobile applications, data processing and analysis, and real-time streaming data. By using a serverless model, developers can focus on building and deploying their applications, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This can result in faster development and deployment times, as well as reduced costs, as users only pay for the resources they actually use.</p><p>Serverless computing is also often used in conjunction with other cloud computing services, such as containers and managed services, to provide a fully-managed and scalable solution for deploying and running applications. Overall, serverless computing offers a number of benefits, including increased scalability, flexibility, and cost savings, making it an attractive option for  many organizations.</p><h2 id="is-serverless-the-future-of-cloud-computing">Is serverless the future of cloud computing?</h2><p>It&apos;s difficult to say for certain whether serverless computing will become the dominant model of cloud computing in the future. While serverless computing does offer a number of benefits, including increased scalability, flexibility, and cost savings, it may not be the best fit for every organization or use case. Additionally, there are still some challenges and limitations to the serverless model, such as the need for careful monitoring and management to ensure that applications are running optimally and to avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources.</p><p>It&apos;s likely that serverless computing will continue to evolve and become more widely adopted in the coming years, but it&apos;s also possible that other models of cloud computing, such as containers or managed services, may also gain popularity. Ultimately, the future of cloud computing will depend on the specific needs and requirements of organizations, as well as the continued development and evolution of cloud computing technologies.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-think-of-the-book-explain-the-cloud-like-im-10">What do you think of the book Explain the Cloud Like I&apos;m 10?</h2><p>As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to read books or browse the internet, so I am unable to comment on the book &quot;Explain the Cloud Like I&apos;m 10&quot;.

The snapshot read is based on a monotonic clock. You can get much better performance out of your monotonic clock if all of your machines have very accurate clocks. When you write to the database, you can add a timestamp to the operation, but you may have to introduce a delay to account for the worst-case error in the clock you used to generate the timestamp. More accurate timestamps -&gt; less delay. From my understanding, less delay -&gt; servers have more capacity -&gt; buy fewer servers -&gt; save millions of dollars -&gt; use savings to pay for salaries of people who figured out how to make super precise timestamps and still come out ahead.</li><li><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/?ref=highscalability.com">Meta</a>: One could argue that we don&#x2019;t really need PTP for that.

The large language models and image generators are only about 1/1000 of that, but they already contain more information than a single human could ever possibly know. It is at least plausible that human level AGI might initially run in a box instead of an entire data center.

This is a super common pattern, often called &quot;fat Lambda&quot;, that has always been a fraction of the cost of the cheapest AWS hardware in my experience. The one exception is if you have enough 24/7 load to require a decently large instance. If you&apos;re running those t3.small kind of ec2&apos;s then you are probably better off with a fat Lambda.</li><li><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mit-century-old-differential-equation-liquid-ai-computational-bottleneck-160035555.html?ref=highscalability.com">MIT Team</a>: Imagine if you have an end-to-end neural network that receives driving input from a camera mounted on a car. The network is trained to generate outputs, like the car&apos;s steering angle. In 2020, the team solved this by using liquid neural networks with 19 nodes, so 19 neurons plus a small perception module could drive a car. A differential equation describes each node of that system. With the closed-form solution, if you replace it inside this network, it would give you the exact behavior, as it&#x2019;s a good approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. They can thus solve the problem with an even lower number of neurons, which means it would be faster and less computationally expensive.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jackclarksf/status/1592691365217173504?ref=highscalability.com">@jackclarkSF</a>: Stability AI (people behind Stable Diffusion and an upcoming Chinchilla -optimal code model) now have 5408 GPUs, up from 4000 earlier this year - per @EMostaque in a Reddit ama</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ahidalgosre/status/1592624122521321472?ref=highscalability.com">@ahidalgosre</a>: Autoscaling is an anti-pattern. Complex services do not scale in any lateral direction, and the vectors via which they do scale are too unknowable/unmeasurable to predict reliably. It&#x2019;s better to slightly under-provision a few instances to find out when they fail &amp; over-provision others to absorb extra traffic.</li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33612610&amp;ref=highscalability.com">joshstrange</a>: I left Aurora serverless (v1, v2 pricing was insane) for PS and I&apos;ve been extremely happy. It was way cheaper and less of a headache than RDS and my actual usage was way less than I anticipated (since it&apos;s hard to think in terms of row reads/writes when working at a high level). With PS I get a dev/qa/staging/prod DB for $30/mo vs spinning up multiple RDS instances. Even with Aurora Serverless (v1) where you can spin down to 0 it was cheaper to go with PS. 1 DB unit on Aurora Serverless (v1) cost like $45/mo (for my 1 prod instance) so for $15 less I got all my other environments without having to wait for them to spin up after they went to sleep.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/swshukla/status/1592555601812652033?ref=highscalability.com">@swshukla</a>: Technical debt does not necessarily mean that the product is poor.

Say for example an auth token not yet expired, but unable to renew, that can spin for a while before failure. But on restart? Dead.</li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32163705&amp;ref=highscalability.com">Gareth321</a>: This is easily one of the most expansive Acts (EU Digital Markets Act) regarding computing devices passed in my lifetime.

Most of this extra overhead comes into play simply because of what Kubernetes is when compared with the other products.</li><li><a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/c839b0d2d6b6417787b1/what-is-the-essence-of.html?ref=highscalability.com">Chris Crawford</a>: Thus, the heart of any computer is a processing machine.

Our new encoding scheme reduced the cost of generating our basic ABR encodings by 94 percent.

This means that today more people on Instagram get to experience clearer video that plays more smoothly.</li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-phones-extended-mind-philosophy/?ref=highscalability.com">Leo Kim</a>: Seen in this light, TikTok&#x2019;s ability to build its transmission model around our relationship to our phones represents a tremendous shift. If TV brought media into people&#x2019;s homes, TikTok dares to bring it directly into our minds. The immediate, passive reception we experience on the platform relies heavily on the context of the phone, just as the familiar reception of television relies on the context of the home.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/yahave/status/1595355545078321152?ref=highscalability.com">@yahave</a>: Two recent papers suggest a beautiful combination of neural and symbolic reasoning.

So, for me QUIC is a lot more than just a few tweaks to TCP&#x2026;QUIC takes this one step further, and pushes the innovation role from platforms to applications, just at the time when platforms are declining in relative importance within the ecosystem. From such a perspective the emergence of an application-centric transport model that provides faster services, a larger repertoire of transport models and encompassing comprehensive encryption was an inevitable development.</li><li><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-11/dark.html?ref=highscalability.com">Geoff Huston</a>: In the shift to shut out all forms of observation and monitoring have we ourselves become collateral damage here? Not only are we handing our digital assets to the surveillance behemoths, we also don&apos;t really understand what assets we are handing over, and nor do we have any practical visibility as to what happens to this data, and whether or not the data will be used in contexts that are hostile to our individual interests.

The left figure shows that the heap usage is basically flat for the new cluster. The right figure shows that the sum of the heap usage is also lower now (14 TiB vs 22 TiB) even though that was not a goal by itself.

This ability to send &#x201C;secure, unhackable&#x201D; software to people is all by itself of a holy grail of cryptography, since it would solve so many problems both theoretical and practical.

<li>I wonder if Snap knows they shouldn&apos;t be using the cloud? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgv0kfp_6xQ&amp;ref=highscalability.com">Snap: Journey of a Snap on Snapchat Using AWS</a>:                   
<ul>
<li> 300 million daily active users. </li>
<li> 5 billion+ snaps per day. </li>
<li> 10 million QPS. </li>
<li> 400 TB stored in DynamoDB, Nightly scans run a 2 billion rows per minute. They look for friend suggestions and deleting ephemeral data. </li>
<li> 900+ EKS clusters, 1000+ instances per cluster. </li>
<li> Sending a snap: client (iOS, Android) sends a request to their gateway service (GW) that runs in EKS. GW talks to a media delivery service (MEDIA). MEDIA sends the snap to cloudfront and S3 so it&apos;s closer to the recipient when they need it. </li>
<li> Once the client has persisted the media it sends a request to the core orchestration services (MCS). MSC checks the friend graph service, which does a permission check on if the message can be sent. The metadata is persisted into SnapDB. </li>
<li> SnapDB is a database that uses DynamDB as its backend. It handles transactions, TTL, and efficiently handles ephemeral data and state synchronization. The controls helps control costs. </li>
<li> Receiving a snap is very latency sensitive. MCS looks up a persistent connection for each user. in Elasticache. The server hosting the connection is found and the message is sent through that server. The media ID is used to get media from Cloudfront. </li>
<li>Moving to this architecture reduced P50 latency by 24%. </li>
<li>Use auto-scaling and instant type optimization (Graviton) to keep compute costs low. </li>

<li>Twitter is performing one of the most interesting natural experiments we&apos;ve ever seen: can you fire most of your software development team and survive? The hard truth is after something is built there&apos;s almost always a layoff simply because you don&apos;t need the same number of people to maintain a thing as it takes to build a thing. But Twitter made a deep cut. It seems likely stuff will stay up in the short term because that&apos;s the way it&apos;s built. But what about when those little things go wrong? Or when you want to change something? Or figure out those trace through those elusive heisenbergs? It will be fascinating to see.                   
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://twitter.com/petrillic/status/1593686223717269504?ref=highscalability.com">@petrillic</a>: for people blathering about &#x201C;just put twitter in the cloud&#x201D; we tried that. i was there. so just to put some numbers out there, let&#x2019;s assume aws gave you a 60% discount. now you&#x2019;re talking approximately 500,000 m6gd.12xlarge systems (new hw was bigger). that&#x2019;s $300MM monthly. and before you add in little things like bandwidth. probably $10MM a month in S3. it&#x2019;s just absurd. there is a reason after investing many thousands of staff+ hours twitter was careful about what it moved. even doing experiments in the cloud required careful deep coordination with the providers. for example, i accidentally saturated the network for an entire region for a few minutes before some sre freaked out and asked what was going on. 1,000 node presto cluster was going on. or the gargantuan bandwidth twitter uses (you think we ran a global network for nothing?). with a 90% discount on aws it would be probably be another $10MM monthly. maybe more. oh and for those going on and on about elastic scale... good luck asking for 50,000 EC2 instances instantly. just because you can provision 20 doesn&apos;t mean you can provision 50,000. even running 1,000 node presto cluster required warming it up at 100,250,500,750 first. not sure i&apos;m the person for that, but realistically, it was mostly latency reduction. there were lots of efforts in 2019-2021 on reducing (tail) latency on requests. also, optomizing a 400Gbps backbone in the datacenter.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/atax1a/status/1594880931042824192?ref=highscalability.com">@atax1a</a>: so now that the dust has settled &#x2014; it sounds like the last person with membership in the group that allows them to turn on writes to config-management left while writes were still locked, and the identity management that would allow them to get into the group is down (:..then there&apos;s all the services that _aren&apos;t_ in Mesos &#x2014; a bunch of the core UNIX stuff like Kerberos, LDAP, and Puppet itself is on bare metal, managed by Puppet. Database and storage clusters have some of their base configs deployed there, too. None of that was on Musk&apos;s diagram. </li>

How many RPCs do you think happen when you do a cold search on Google? I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if it were &gt;1000. Between search, ads, user profile, nav bar on top, location databases, etc. This is just how mature distributed distributed systems work...*sigh* it doesn&#x2019;t work like that. Typically you have a few API calls from the client to a datacenter and then, within the datacenter, you have a flurry of traffic to pull everything together. </li>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jbell/status/1588286812841119744?ref=highscalability.com">@jbell</a>: Flash forward to 2022. Over 5 years, we&#x2019;ve migrated almost every api used by the Twitter app into a unified graphql interface. Getting api changes into production used to be measured in weeks, now it&apos;s measured in hours. For the last 2 years, EVERY SINGLE new Twitter feature was delivered on this api platform. Twitter blue, spaces, tweet edit, birdwatch, and many many many others. This api platform serves your home timeline, every tweet embedded in your favorite nytimes article, and the entirety of the 3rd-party developer api which uses our graphql system to fulfill every part of every api request. Just in this calendar year, there have been over 1000 changes to this graphql api by over 300 developers at Twitter. The api serves 1.5 BILLION graphql fields per second across 3000 different data types. The system is vast, developerable, and efficient. </li>

<li><a href="https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/the-serverless-spectrum-147b02cb2292?ref=highscalability.com">The Serverless Spectrum</a>. I really don&apos;t think serverless is a spectrum. Something is serverless if you can use the service through an API without having to worry about the underlying architecture. When you charge a minimum of $700, like AWS does for Open Search, it&apos;s not serverless. That minimum charge means you are paying for fixed resources. That&apos;s not serverless. That&apos;s not on the spectrum. FaaS is different from serverless because we&apos;ve seen new container based HTTP serverless options like Cloud Run and App Runner that aren&apos;t oriented around functions, so we need to keep FaaS to label services like AWS Lambda. </li>

<li>Roblox outage because of new features under load lead to a <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2022/01/roblox-return-to-service-10-28-10-31-2021/?ref=highscalability.com">73 hour outage at Roblox</a>. Great incident report.                   
<ul>
<li> Roblox&#x2019;s core infrastructure runs in Roblox data centers. We deploy and manage our own hardware, as well as our own compute, storage, and networking systems on top of that hardware. The scale of our deployment is significant, with over 18,000 servers and 170,000 containers. </li>
<li> we leverage a technology suite commonly known as the &#x201C;HashiStack.&#x201D; Nomad, Consul and Vault </li>
<li>At this point, the team developed a new theory about what was going wrong: increased traffic&#x2026;the team started looking at Consul internals for clues..Over the next 10 hours, the engineering team dug deeper into debug logs and operating system-level metrics.  This data showed Consul KV writes getting blocked for long periods of time. In other words, &#x201C;contention.&#x201D; </li>
<li>On October 27th at 14:00, one day before the outage, we enabled this feature on a backend service that is responsible for traffic routing. As part of this rollout, in order to prepare for the increased traffic we typically see at the end of the year, we also increased the number of nodes supporting traffic routing by 50%. We disabled the streaming feature for all Consul systems, including the traffic routing nodes. The config change finished propagating at 15:51, at which time the 50th percentile for Consul KV writes lowered to 300ms. We finally had a breakthrough. </li>
<li>Why was streaming an issue?  HashiCorp explained that, while streaming was overall more efficient, it used fewer concurrency control elements (Go channels) in its implementation than long polling.  Under very high load &#x2013; specifically, both a very high read load and a very high write load &#x2013; the design of streaming exacerbates the amount of contention on a single Go channel,  which causes blocking during writes, making it significantly less efficient </li>
<li>The caching system was unhealthy so they restarted it: To avoid a flood, we used DNS steering to manage the number of players who could access Roblox. This allowed us to let in a certain percentage of randomly selected players while others continued to be redirected to our static maintenance page. Every time we increased the percentage, we checked database load, cache performance, and overall system stability. Work continued throughout the day, ratcheting up access in roughly 10% increments. </li>
<li>Running all Roblox backend services on one Consul cluster left us exposed to an outage of this nature. We have already built out the servers and networking for an additional, geographically distinct data center that will host our backend services. We have efforts underway to move to multiple availability zones within these data centers </li>

<li>Basecamp and HEY are moving on out&#x2014;of the cloud. <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0?ref=highscalability.com">Why we&apos;re leaving the cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.rework.fm/leaving-the-cloud/?ref=highscalability.com">podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8jg4Z6BDY&amp;ref=highscalability.com">Why You Should Leave the Cloud &#x2013; David Heinemeier Hannsson DHH</a>.                   
<ul>
<li>we have a pretty large cloud budget and gonna have some of the more specific numbers, but I think we&#x2019;re at about $3 million a year </li>
<li>Renting computers is (mostly) a bad deal for medium-sized companies like ours with stable growth. The savings promised in reduced complexity never materialized. So we&apos;re making our plans to leave. </li>
<li>Let&apos;s take HEY as an example. We&apos;re paying over half a million dollars per year for database (RDS) and search (ES) services from Amazon. Do you know how many insanely beefy servers you could purchase on a budget of half a million dollars per year? </li>
<li>Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is &quot;simple&quot; has clearly never tried. </li>
<li>We have gone from a hundred percent of our servers being, or more or less a hundred percent of our servers being on Preem and knowing what that takes to operate. We currently run base cam three, our, well four now actually base cam four. We run base cam four on our own servers predominantly. </li>
<li>First of all, we don&#x2019;t even rack the hardware. No one goes when we buy a new server. No one drives from wherever they live in the country to the data center, unpack the box, slot it into machine. No, no, no, they&#x2019;re data centers who rent out what&#x2019;s called this white glove service. They unwrap it, they put it in your rack, they connect the the cables and then we remotely set it up. And what we&#x2019;ve just found is like, that&#x2019;s just not where the bulk of the complexity is hidden. </li>
<li>And I think there&#x2019;s just something for me, aesthetically offensive about that. Not just a perversion of the Internet&#x2019;s architecture and, and setup, but also this idea that these big tech companies, and I certainly include both Amazon and Google in that camp they&#x2019;re already too big, too powerful. </li>
<li>Thus I consider it a duty that we at 37signals do our part to swim against the stream. We have a business model that&apos;s incredibly compatible with owning hardware and writing it off over many years. Growth trajectories that are mostly predictable. Expert staff who might as well employ their talents operating our own machines as those belonging to Amazon or Google. </li>
<li>The cloud is not should you build your own power plant, but should you buy or rent your own dishwasher. </li>
<li>They were not saving on complexity. They were not running using fewer operations people, so why bother with the cloud? </li>
<li>Will be using S3 for quite a while. </li>
<li>OK, they aren&apos;t actually swimming against the stream. They are exactly in the stream making decisions based on their skill set, requirements and workload. Since it doesn&apos;t sound like they have a very cloud native architecture, the transition should be relatively seamless. Many people do not have the ops people and the DBAs to run these kinds of systems, so others will make different decisions based on their needs. </li>
<li>Also, <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/building-basecamp-4-405a347f?ref=highscalability.com">Building Basecamp 4</a>. Though we don&apos;t really know what their architecture is like. I assume they are just renting machines, which if you have a good ops team is not an efficient use of funds. </li>

Remember, the difference between Cloudflare and other cloud platforms is that they are an edge platform provider. Your code works everywhere they have a point of presence, not in just a datacenter. So it&apos;s a harder problem to solve. They are piecing together all the base parts of a platform. They call it the Supercloud. As everyone seems to hate every neologism, I&apos;m assuming Supercloud will be derided as well. What&apos;s on their platform?

<li>Wired up predefined access patterns in NoSQL are more performant than SQL queries on a relational database. But why can&apos;t relational databases compete using materialized views?

<li>With PlanetScale Boost, we&#x2019;re trying to do the opposite. Instead of planning how to fetch the data every time you read from your database, we want to plan how to process the data every time you write to your database. We want to process your data, so that reading from it afterward becomes essentially free. We want a very complex plan to apply to your writes, so there&#x2019;s no planning to be done for your reads; a plan where we push data on writes instead of pulling data on reads. </li>
<li>A query in PlanetScale Boost can also miss, but we try to be much smarter about the way we resolve these misses. </li>

<li>AI continues to be almost most useful.                    
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/?ref=highscalability.com">Kite is saying farewell</a>: We built the most-advanced AI for helping developers at the time, but it fell short of the 10&#xD7; improvement required to break through because the state of the art for ML on code is not good enough. You can see this in Github Copilot, which is built by Github in collaboration with Open AI. As of late 2022, Copilot shows a lot of promise but still has a long way to go. The largest issue is that state-of-the-art models don&#x2019;t understand the structure of code, such as non-local context. </li>
<li><a href="https://joel.tools/codegen/?ref=highscalability.com">AI Found a Bug in My Code</a>: I had the model look at some existing code and rank the probability of each token appearing given the previous tokens. I also had it suggest its own token and compared the probability of my token to the probability of the model&apos;s token&#x2026;I did not plan this, but it turns out there is a bug in my code. When an event listener is removed during dispatch, I return from the function. Hovering over the suspicious code, the model correctly suggests continue. </li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33635742&amp;ref=highscalability.com">nradov</a>: Yes and I raised the same concern when GitHub Copilot was released. If our code contains so little entropy that an AI can reliably predict the next sequence of tokens then that is evidence we are operating at too low a level of abstraction. Such tools can certainly be helpful in working with today&apos;s popular languages, but what would a future language that allows for abstracting away all that boilerplate look like? </li>

<li>Good question. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPIQKuhvmxc&amp;ref=highscalability.com">What will Serverless 2.0 look like?</a>:                   
<ul>
<li>Make all services serverless so we don&apos;t have to manage anything, they scale to zero, and we shouldn&apos;t have to worry about instance sizes. </li>
<li> Better caching, orchestration, HPC, etc. </li>
<li> DynamoDB is easy to adopt and hard to change and adapt to new access patterns. </li>
<li> Deploying functions never works the first time. Permissions wrong. Wiring wrong. Need something to check that a function will run when deployed. </li>
<li> Need faster deployment. </li>
<li> Infrastructure as code for works for functions, but not for everything else. Need better support for wiring, networking, and security. </li>
<li> Microsoft invested a lot in owning where developers live: Cloud-based editor, VsCode GitHub, and NPM. You can build and deploy with GitHub actions. Copilot can write half the code for you. </li>

<li>Just use NoSQL from the start. <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/from-postgres-to-amazon-dynamodb-4791220b2d5d?ref=highscalability.com">From Postgres to Amazon DynamoDB</a>:

<li>Instacart is the leading online grocery company in North America. Users can shop from more than 75,000 stores with more than 500 million products on shelves. We have millions of active users who regularly place multiple orders with tens of items in their cart every month. </li>
<li>Our primary datastore of choice is Postgres, and we have gotten by for a long time by pushing it to its limits, but once specific use cases began to outpace the largest Amazon EC2 instance size Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers, we realized we needed a different solution. After evaluating several other alternatives, we landed on Amazon DynamoDB being the best fit for these use cases. </li>
<li>With a few features planned for release, we were projecting to send 8x more notifications every day than our baseline! We knew that as we continued to scale, a single Postgres instance would not be able to support the required throughput. </li>
<li>The ability to scale on-demand would be a plus to general cost efficiency as well as our ability to test and launch future features that change the volume of messages sent dramatically </li>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/stefanwild/status/1595181229388824576?ref=highscalability.com">@stefanwild</a>: Yes, that&#x2019;s roughly our approach. If it&#x2019;s a new, somewhat standalone table that is either a straightforward fit for Dynamo and/or a workload that Postgres won&#x2019;t handle well, we do use Dynamo from the start. The bar to migrate existing Postgres tables is a bit higher&#x2026;Rather difficult for our heaviest workloads. But that and challenges with denormalization are probably topics for another blog post or two </li>

<ul>
<li>We have more than 500 microservices at Tinder, which talk to each other for different data needs using a service mesh under the hood. </li>
<li>Tinder is used in 190 countries and gets all kinds of traffic from all over the world. </li>
<li>Before TAG existed, we leveraged multiple API Gateway solutions and each application team used a different 3rd party API Gateway solution. Since each of the gateways was built on a different tech stack, managing them became a cumbersome effort. </li>
<li>TAG is a JVM-based framework built on top of Spring Cloud Gateway. Application teams can use TAG to create their own instance of API Gateway by just writing configurations. It centralizes all external facing APIs and enforces strict authorization and security rules at Tinder. TAG extends components like gateway and global filter of Spring Cloud Gateway to provide generic and pre-built filters: Weighted routing, Request/Response transformations, HTTP to GRPC conversion, and more </li>
<li>TAG is also used by other Match Group brands like Hinge, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Ship, etc. Thus TAG is serving B2C and B2B traffic for Tinder. </li>

<ul>
<li> That roughly translated to 75 GB billed from the query. This immediately raised an alarm because BigQuery is charged by data processed per query. If each query scans 75 GB of data, then we&#x2019;re looking at approximately 194,400,000 GB of data scanned per month. According to BigQuery&#x2019;s on-demand pricing scheme, it would cost us $949,218.75 USD per month! </li>
<li> We created a clustered dataset on two feature columns from the query&#x2019;s WHERE clause. We then ran the exact same query and the log now showed 508.1 MB billed. That&#x2019;s 150 times less data scanned than the previous unclustered table. That would bring our cost down to approximately $1,370.67 USD per month, which is way more reasonable. </li>

<li>After reaching the limit of vertical scaling of our previous system, we were pleased to implement a real solution that provides (in a practical sense) unlimited scalability of Titus read-only API. We were able to achieve better tail latencies with a minor sacrifice in median latencies when traffic is low, and gained the ability to horizontally scale out our API gateway processing layer to handle growth in traffic without changes to API clients. </li>

<ul>
<li>we expected to roughly triple throughput per instance from this migration, as 12xl instances have three times the number of vCPUs compared to 4xl instances. We can see that as we reached roughly the same CPU target of 55%, the throughput increased only by ~25% on average, falling far short of our desired goal. What&#x2019;s worse, average latency degraded by more than 50%, with both CPU and latency patterns becoming more &#x201C;choppy.&#x201D; </li>
<li>In this blogpost we described how we were able to leverage PMCs in order to find a bottleneck in the JVM&#x2019;s native code, patch it, and subsequently realize better than a threefold increase in throughput for the workload in question. When it comes to this class of performance issues, the ability to introspect the execution at the level of CPU microarchitecture proved to be the only solution. Intel vTune provides valuable insight even with the core set of PMCs, such as those exposed by m5.12xl instance type. </li>

<li>The maximumBatching Window in Seconds was changed from 0 to 3. We observed that it only adds 2- digit ms delay to ingestion time and brings significant cost reduction. </li>
<li>Runtime Architecture is changed from X86_64 to ARM64. This results in no visible performance increase for our case but AWS charges 25% less for ARM64 </li>

<ul>
<li>a few years of growth later, we&#x2019;re handling over 70,000 pages per minute, storing around 560 million pages, and paying well over $1,000,000 per year. </li>
<li>we were able to cut costs by 80% in a little over three months </li>
<li>Migrate the cached pages and traffic onto Prerender&#x2019;s own internal servers and cut our reliance on AWS as quickly as possible. When we did a cost projection we estimated that we could reduce our hosting fees by 40%, and decided a server migration </li>
<li> When we did a cost projection we estimated that we could reduce our hosting fees by 40%, and decided a server migration </li>
<li> When the writes to S3 had been stopped completely, Prerender saved $200 a day on S3 API costs </li>
<li> In the last four weeks, we moved most of the cache workload from AWS S3 to our own Cassandra cluster. The daily cost of AWS was reduced to $1.1K per day, projecting to 35K per month, and the new servers&#x2019; monthly recurring cost was estimated to be around 14K. </li>
<li> The true hidden price for AWS is coming from the traffic cost, they sell a reasonably priced storage, and it&#x2019;s even free to upload it. But when you get it out, you pay an enormous cost. In our case, it was easy around the $30k &#x2014; $50k per month. By the end of phase two, we had reduced our total monthly server costs down by 41.2%. </li>
<li>This step involved moving all the Amazon RDS instances shard by shard. Our monthly server fees dropped below our initial estimate of 40% to a full 80% by the time all the cached pages were redirected. </li>

<ul>
<li>Today we are excited to talk about Pingora, a new HTTP proxy we&#x2019;ve built in-house using Rust that serves over 1 trillion requests a day, boosts our performance, and enables many new features for Cloudflare customers, all while requiring only a third of the CPU and memory resources of our previous proxy infrastructure. </li>
<li>We chose Rust as the language of the project because it can do what C can do in a memory safe way without compromising performance. </li>
<li>The next design decision was around our workload scheduling system. We chose multithreading over multiprocessing in order to share resources, especially connection pools, easily. We also decided that work stealing was required to avoid some classes of performance problems mentioned above. </li>
<li>We decided to implement a &#x201C;life of a request&#x201D; event based programmable interface similar to NGINX/OpenResty </li>
<li>Overall traffic on Pingora shows 5ms reduction on median TTFB and 80ms reduction on the 95th percentile. The savings come from our new architecture which can share connections across all threads. This means a better connection reuse ratio, which spends less time on TCP and TLS handshakes. Pingora makes only a third as many new connections per second compared to the old service. For one major customer, it increased the connection reuse ratio from 87.1% to 99.92%, which reduced new connections to their origins by 160x. </li>
<li>Pingora consumes about 70% less CPU and 67% less memory compared to our old service with the same traffic load. </li>
<li>Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. </li>

It means removing implicit trust inside the network. You don&apos;t log in at layer 3 or layer 4 and then have trust inside the network. You still have single-sign-on, but you log in at the application layer. Zero trust is about least privilege and getting more information about the users using the system.

Is it a good idea? Would it actually solve any problems? My answers are no and no, but probably not for the reasons you think. Let&apos;s dive in.</p><p>Here are a few useful resources for exploring this argument:</p><ul><li>Maintaining monopolies with the cloud by Cory Doctorow. https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/28/other-peoples-computers.</li><li>A group advocating for fair licensing. https://www.fairsoftwarelicensing.com/our-principles.</li><li>Cloud Infrastructure Services -- An analysis of potentially anti-competitive practices by  Professor Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Jenny. https://www.fairsoftwarestudy.com/.</li></ul><p>Now Cory is about 100x times smarter than I am, but this analogy is wrong:</p><blockquote>That&apos;s why the trustbusters were so big on &quot;structural separation&quot;: the principle that a business can own a platform or use the platform, but not both.</blockquote><p>So this remedy is also wrong:</p><blockquote>Rather than trying to construct rules that kept the referee honest even when they played on one of the teams, they ordered the companies to choose one role &#x2013; either you were the ref, or you were a player, but you couldn&apos;t referee a match where you were also in the competition.</blockquote><p>Because this idea, while trivially true, misses the point:</p><blockquote>There is no cloud, there is only other people&apos;s computers.</blockquote><p>This is like saying there is no human body, it&apos;s just a collection of cells. While true, it is the lesser truth that fails to recognize the importance of the body, organs, and the adaptive function of the brain. That&apos;s what a cloud provider is; it&apos;s the body electric for the cloud.</p><p>The report by Professor Jenny seems to be the main support for cleaving cloud providers in two.</p><p>I&apos;ve read the report. Is there a smoking gun? Not that I found. But then, I&apos;m not interested in enterprise licensing woes with Oracle or Office 365. What I&apos;m concerned about, as a developer, is the collateral damage such ham-fisted regulation might cause.</p><p>The job of a cloud is to run workloads. Workloads are implemented using services. A cloud offers those services. The more high-quality services a cloud offers, the better products we can build.</p><p>Limit the cloud services a cloud provider can offer and you limit the quality of the software we can build. It would be like removing legos from a lego set. You can&apos;t do a proper build without the full set.</p><p>There is no arbitrary dividing line that can be made such that platform services are on one side of the line and non-platform services are on the other side. A cloud is a platform all the way down. Without cloud services, there is no cloud because a cloud is literally defined by the services it offers.</p><p>A cloud provider packages up vast pools of compute resources and resells them as cloud services. There is no structural separation as there is with a train service. What some consider infrastructure or platform is just another cloud service.</p><p>Would you really trust some committee or government agency to draw this line correctly? I would not because I don&apos;t think the people who think this way actually understand how the cloud works.</p><p>Does anyone really want to go back to the VM-centric days when we rolled everything ourselves? No.</p><p>What it means to be cloud-native has gone through several evolutions: VM to container to serverless. Each cloud-native evolution is about using the hardware more efficiently.</p><p>Do you think those evolutions would have happened with a structural separation in place? No.</p><p>Where&apos;s the incentive unless you derive a benefit from optimizing the whole stack? We would still be building higher and higher on top of VMs because that&apos;s where platform innovation would have stopped evolving.</p><p>This is because the cloud is not a railroad. They are different in kind. Building software is not moving freight. A railroad is fixed. The cloud is ever evolving.</p><p>This is my best argument for why the cloud should not be vertically separated. It would make the job of building quality software even harder and slower and more expensive.</p><p>Admittedly, it&apos;s a developer focussed argument, but there are more technical arguments against the move. Let&apos;s walk through them.</p><h2 id="is-the-cloud-a-natural-monopoly">Is The Cloud a Natural Monopoly?</h2><p>Wikipedia:</p><blockquote>A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors.</blockquote><p>Let&apos;s look at the size of the market. For all the attention the cloud gets, it&apos;s still a child or maybe a pre-teen in terms of the overall IT industry.</p><p>The market value of the worldwide IT industry is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-industries-world-2021-150703784.html?ref=highscalability.com">$5 trillion</a>. The global cloud computing industry was valued at $371 billion in 2020.</p><p>So, the cloud is not a monopoly. Why should it be regulated as one?</p><p>Examples of traditional natural monopolies are dams, railroads, power plants, water supply, and sewer services. The idea is it&apos;s practical to only have one of these for a given area. And even that list is not invulnerable. With solar power, the centralization of power generation is giving way to a more decentralized model.</p><p>Does the <em>there can be only one</em> apply to the cloud? No. Network effects are not the same as monopoly control.</p><p>Apple is not a monopoly in the smartphone market simply because people like their smartphones. Neither are clouds. People choose to run their workloads on the cloud from a large set of options. It&apos;s a choice. It&apos;s not because there are no other options available to them because of structural issues.</p><p>While high infrastructure costs do create a barrier to entry to creating a cloud provider, this misses an important point: the benefits of the cloud come from the cloud model, not any particular cloud implementation.</p><p>Here&apos;s an informal definition of a cloud provider taken from my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explain-Cloud-Like-Im-10/dp/0979707110?ref=highscalability.com">Explain the Cloud Like I&apos;m 10</a>:</p><blockquote>A cloud provider installs a bunch of computers in a bunch of datacenters spread throughout the world, pools all those datacenter resources together, offers them over the internet as cloud services through an API, and rents them to the public in an on-demand, pay-for-what-you-use basis.</blockquote><p>The cloud model means accessing services over a network through an API, safely running multiple workloads on a single server, cloud storage, cloud computing, auto-scaling, elasticity, resource pooling, on-demand pay-for-what-you-use billing, load balancing, fault tolerance, leveraging managed services, and building software using a cloud-native paradigm.</p><p>The cloud model has rightly attracted customers because it&apos;s a powerful way to create, distribute, and use software, but the cloud model is not relegated to only the cloud.</p><p>The cloud model and, thus, cloud-native software development can work in any context&#x2014;on-prem, colo, hybrid, edge, bare-metal. It&#x2019;s the model that matters. Not who implements it or how it&#x2019;s implemented.</p><p>This is what I mean when I say people aren&apos;t understanding the cloud. They over-index on specific cloud implementation instances and not the value and flexibility of the cloud model itself.  Does the free market work for the cloud?</p><p>Another way to address the natural monopoly questions is to answer: does the free market work for the cloud?</p><p>This is where we have a problem. Like telecom, the cloud provider market slipped into oligopoly. There is little incentive for the Big 3 to drive costs lower, but that&apos;s not the same as having a monopoly that should split and regulate an industry.</p><p>There are many alternatives for running workloads. Take a look at this still incomplete list of cloud providers from Wikipedia. The problem is there&apos;s no easy alternatives for running workloads, and that&apos;s because there is no standard cloud API.</p><p>We have a cloud model that offers a cloud-native method of software development, but it may take several more technological evolutions for the model to advance enough to have a minimal viable portability layer. With container-native PaaS (App Runner and Cloud Run) we are getting close.</p><p>We have several players like Cloudflare innovating to become alternative lower-cost cloud providers. And we have k8s striving to become a cloud in a box droppable into any datacenter. You can switch between clouds with effort. It has been done. You can even go old school and use non cloud-native architectures. Anyone can rent a rack in a colo and stand up a system. Did anyone promise you a rose garden? I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>The larger point is there is a large competitive market amongst a group of competing enterprises. There&apos;s just no easy solution to the perceived problem of fungible cloud alternatives.</p><p>Is there a way to create greater competition and expand economic choice for cloud customers? I don&apos;t know, but high switching costs isn&apos;t a proper test for regulating an industry. It&apos;s a technical issue that&apos;s fixable with effort and investment. Maybe start investing into open source alternatives rather than complaining they don&apos;t already exist? Invent the future you want. A Cloud Provider Absorbs Huge Fixed and Sunk Costs</p><p>Cloud providers incur huge fixed costs for creating and maintaining a network of datacenters spread throughout the word. Let&apos;s say you regulate cloud providers by requiring them to decouple platform services from their other services, whatever those services may be.</p><p>Then we must rely on third parties to fill in the gap with managed services of all varieties that must operate out of every datacenter while surviving datacenter level and region level failures.</p><p>That&apos;s easy to do, right? Of course not, but let&apos;s ignore that very few organizations in the world have the technological know-how to create such managed services, especially without low level control of the entire system. But we&apos;re ignoring that.</p><p>The fixed and sunk costs incurred by the cloud provider will dwarf any investment from third party service providers.</p><p>How do you create the right incentives for the cloud provider to keep investing huge amounts of capital in infrastructure while recovering its fixed costs? If competitive service level pricing levels do not cover the cost of the infrastructure then prices would have to be raised to a level that would deny lower-margin users.</p><p>We&apos;ve seen telecom rest and vest on their installed infrastructure, rent seeking by a combination of regulatory capture and the avoidance of the infrastructure investments that would improve and maintain the system.</p><p>The disincentive to game service pricing levels in order to create short-term profits at the expense of long-term investment will be overwhelming. It will be impossible to properly set service prices at a level that will provide the ROI required by cloud providers, third party service providers, while minimizing costs for customers so they also can earn an adequate ROI. There&apos;s simply not enough room for everyone to get their piece of the pie. What we&apos;ll inevitably see are the constantly rising prices and declining service levels experienced in other industries that are regulated as utilities.</p><p>This is the single greatest weakness of the proposal for vertically separating cloud providers.</p><p>Is that the kind of cloud you want?</p><h2 id="benefits-of-vertical-integration">Benefits of Vertical Integration</h2><p>Where is the optimal point of vertical separation in a cloud provider&apos;s stack of services? What are the consequences of making the wrong decision?</p><p>Any deliberation must recognize the technological interdependence between cloud infrastructure technology and the cloud services that can be offered.</p><p>There&apos;s a huge short-term and long-term efficiency of services that depends on the successful coordination of cloud services and infrastructure.</p><p>For example, AWS created Nitro. Nitro is a revolutionary combination of purpose-built hardware and software designed to provide performance and security. Would Nitro have been invented if AWS was restricted to being a platform provider? Unlikely. It would have had no way of propagating Nitro across an entire vertical stack of hardware and software services. So why bother innovating?</p><p>Vertically-integrated cloud providers can optimize the entire system by ensuring that each component is combined in sub-systems that work together and are optimized as whole.</p><p>One consequence of this tight integration is the overall high reliability offered by clouds. How reliable would the cloud be if a cloud provider did not control their entire stack of services? Given the experience with finger pointing in other highly interdependent systems, it would be less reliable and outages would no doubt last longer.</p><p>Are there any positive externalities to cloud providers that might justify keeping cloud providers? Very large integrated cloud providers might reduce the overall number of servers required to run the world&apos;s workloads, but that&apos;s not sufficient reason for me not to regulate them. I think my other arguments are reason enough.</p><p>Please leave our legos alone.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sponsored Post: G-Core Labs, Close, Wynter, Pinecone, Kinsta, Bridgecrew, IP2Location, StackHawk, InterviewCamp.io, Educative, Stream, Fauna, Triplebyte]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://highscalability.com/content/images/2024/02/5781449767_54902da8a5_o-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h2 id="who-s-hiring">Who&apos;s Hiring?</h2><ul><li><strong>Close</strong> is building the sales communication platform of the future and we&apos;re looking for a <strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> to help us accomplish that goal.

Its $1 for 6M invocations. The whole point is stateless on-demand to achieve 100% utilization. Said another way, provisioned server capacity is not 100% utilization. We over provisioned them to allow for spikes. Comparisons where the Lambda is being invoked 24/7 is totally disingenuous. A cluster of servers running 24/7 mostly idle is *not* the same thing. Statelessness is a feature. It enables 100% utilization and, more often than not, that efficiency will translate directly to saving big $$$ not costing more. <br></li><li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computing-expert-says-programmers-need-more-math-20220517/?ref=highscalability.com">Leslie Lamport</a>: Well, they didn&#x2019;t have an algorithm, just a bunch of code. Very few programmers think in terms of algorithms. When trying to write a concurrent system, if you just code it without having algorithms, there&#x2019;s no way that your program is not going to be full of bugs&#x2026;Yes, the importance of thinking and writing before you code needs to be taught in undergraduate computer science courses and it&#x2019;s not. And the reason is that there&#x2019;s no communication between the people who teach programming and the people who teach program verification. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jmhodges/status/1522385068974432256?ref=highscalability.com">@jmhodges</a>: GraphQL makes your public API equal to a generic database and -- worse -- a generic graph database.

Generally speaking 99% of apps never break 1000 rps. Even with that you can likely serve millions of active users in a month. 1k rps comes easily with Lambda, or Fargate, or DIY with EC2/ECS/EKS/etc. You won&apos;t stress a load balancer with this much traffic. you likely won&apos;t stress a database of any major recent engine either. Internally facing enterprise apps (a surprising amount of the IT footprint for most companies) barely break 10s of RPS. Again why would you even run a server for any of that. As soon as we find a way for people to really understand async patterns, to realize that cached data gets you pretty far for a lot of apps, and that not running a server 24/7 just to HA a 2 rps app can be ok, then we&apos;ll see true sustainability of IT <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/aeduhm/status/1509475990375960576?ref=highscalability.com">@aeduhm</a>: I do this for a multi-region setup where I want a single custom domain with latency routing to hit the closest AppSync API.

Unfortunately nobody has succeeded to demonstrate a good compiler of this kind. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly/status/1513169222444228609?ref=highscalability.com">@werner</a>: I still get annoyed by every piece of AWS that is not #serverless! <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/benschwarz/status/1544453156767092736?ref=highscalability.com">@benschwarz</a>: This is true, at least in my experience. In the earlier days, for a long while @Calibreapp handled tens of millions of API requests per month on a $7 heroku dyno.

Don&apos;t be afraid to populate them with information. Names, dates, URL of pipelines, project information, etc. And, if what you are creating is disposable mark it so. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/joeemison/status/1543277735291899906?ref=highscalability.com">@JoeEmison</a>: Checking back in on the Branch AWS bill; I think I last posted about 2 years ago, when it was still under $1,000/month. In the meantime, Branch has grown ~15X YoY for two years, and so the bill has also grown, to just around $10K/month. As a reminder, Branch is fully serverless, and carries a complete copy of production into every staging/test/etc environment, as well as every developer environment. Every developer has his/her own AWS account (also too with every other environment). Biggest spend is on DynamoDB at $4k/mo. We do buy capacity for some tables in prod, but otherwise go on demand. The majority of our DynamoDB cost is in backups, not in usage. Next is Lambda, at around $2200/mo. We do buy some provisioned capacity for Lambda, but might stop soon (not sure it&apos;s doing much for us). If we do that, the bill should be closer to $1700/mo. We have zero devops full time. Our more senior developers do all our devops in PRs. It&#x2019;s a minimal amount of time. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1497986995380969475?ref=highscalability.com">@doctorow</a>: In other words, Amazon has converted its &quot;customer-centric&quot; personalization system, which emphasized the products it predicted you would like best, into an auction house, where the products that have paid the most come first. Amazon sellers - 60% of sales and rising - must choose between spending on &#xA0;better products or better placement on Amazon. If they choose better products, you&apos;ll never find them. Amazon made $32b last year contributing to the crapification of everything it sold. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/t3rabytes/status/1503765350588076041?ref=highscalability.com">@t3rabytes</a>: For the last 6 months I&apos;ve been planning a mega infra migration for the &#xA0;@EpicGames Store and this morning we pulled it off without a hitch. That&apos;s: - a new domain for the Store (www. -&gt; store.) - a new AWS account - raw EC2 to Kubernetes - additional CDN connectivity. The biggest drivers for this were SEO and single point of failure reduction. Beyond that though, we get some insane eng quality of life improvements -- prod deploy time drops from 45 minutes to 6, ephemeral/branch envs, faster auto-scaling, etc. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/_amanda_walker/status/1542641270677438469?ref=highscalability.com">@_Amanda_Walker</a>: As a Xoogler, I did a bunch of the opposite. &#xA0;&quot;We don&apos;t need X, we&apos;re not Google.&quot; X = stuff like &quot;microservice architecture&quot;, &quot;hot failover&quot;, &quot;ability to handle millions of qps&quot;, etc. &#xA0;At one point I said &quot;I could run production on my laptop. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry about scaling yet.&quot; <br></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31907374&amp;ref=highscalability.com">huksley</a>: made a mistake and accidentally created a serverless function that called itself.

It has already run for 24 hours, using over 70 million Gb-Second! <br></li><li><a href="https://ably.com/blog/distributed-architecture-edge-messaging?ref=highscalability.com">Ably</a>: Round trip latency from any of our 205 global points of presence (PoPs) that receive at least 1% of our traffic: &lt; 65ms for the 99th percentile (measured at the PoP boundary within the Ably access network, which will be closer than a datacenter). <br></li><li><a>Plausible</a>: We moved from our PostgreSQL database to ClickHouse to make the app much faster and handle much bigger websites.

We have gone from about 500,000 titles available in 1990 to about 20 million titles available today. We have gone from perhaps 15 or 20 publishers with their own distribution organization that were real competitors for most books an agent might sell in 1990 to five (soon to be four) today. We have gone from a world where nobody could effectively deliver a book without a publishing organization in 1990 to one where anybody can today. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/gergelyorosz/status/1538595698274455552?ref=highscalability.com">@GergelyOrosz</a>: Years of working in Uber&#x2019;s payments team changed my view on distributed systems where participants can make money. I don&#x2019;t believe any such distributed system can be as efficient as a centralised one. A centralised system spends SO much on fraud reduction and customer support. In ~10 years there&#x2019;s been much talk on building a P2P version of Uber. Yet it never gained momentum. Any such system is doomed to fail as many drivers &amp; riders would abuse the system to maximise short-term profits. Incredible what both parties do to make or save money. What changed my belief is seeing all the things drivers do to make money (using every single arbitrage opportunity - eg forcing riders to cancel &amp; collect the cancel fee, as this is more profitable at eg airports) and also riders (from money laundering to car theft etc). <br></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31785724&amp;ref=highscalability.com">glenngillen</a>: as for the service dynamic: the whole &quot;2 pizza team&quot; thing is both a blessing and a curse IMO. Once you launch a service at AWS&#x2019;s scale you&#x2019;ve immediately got tens of thousands of users. And AWS takes stability/availability/scalability incredibly seriously. I think it&#x2019;s more likely that team is now in a permanent operations mode fixing weird edge cases you find at scale and keeping the lights on. <br></li><li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-computer-scientist-who-parlays-failures-into-breakthroughs-20220613/?ref=highscalability.com">Daniel Spielman</a>: That&#x2019;s true with a lot of my research.

This division gave us a bit of additional structure and a better indication of where coupling and duplication existed, without the extra weight and challenges of microservices. <br></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/boristane/status/1487850421536411650?ref=highscalability.com">@BorisTane</a>: if your team is building abstraction layers on top of managed cloud services in an effort to remain &quot;vendor-agnostic&quot;, you&apos;re seriously doing this wrong instead, embrace the services at your disposal and use all their relevant features. don&apos;t drive the lowest common denominator <br></li><li><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-02/addresses.html?ref=highscalability.com">Geoff Huston</a>: So perhaps an address these days is just an ephemeral transport token that distinguishes one packet flow from another, and really has little more in the way of semantic meaning. In this world what&#x2019;s holding the Internet together is not IP addresses and routing: it&apos;s the DNS and the common name system. <br></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31487706&amp;ref=highscalability.com">temuze</a>: Back at my old job in ~2016, we built a cheap homegrown data warehouse via Postgres, SQLite and Lambda. Basically, it worked like this: - All of our data lived in compressed SQLite DBs on S3. - Upon receiving a query, Postgres would use a custom foreign data wrapper we built. - This FDW would forward the query to a web service. - This web service would start one lambda per SQLite file. Each lambda would fetch the file, query it, and return the result to the web service. - This web service would re-issue lambdas as needed and return the results to the FDW. - Postgres (hosted on a memory-optimized EC2 instance) would aggregate. It was straight magic. Separated compute + storage with basically zero cost and better performance than Redshift and Vertica. All of our data was time-series data, so it was extraordinarily easy to partition. &#xA0;Also, it was also considerably cheaper than Athena. On Athena, our queries would cost us ~$5/TB (which hasn&apos;t changed today!), so it was easily &gt;$100 for most queries and we were running thousands of queries per hour. <br></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30636657&amp;ref=highscalability.com">jiggawatts</a>: This is mere kilobytes of data over the length of the entire movie, and can tolerate hours of latency for most aspects (e.g.: analysis, charge-back, ML, etc...). A lot of the time I look at &quot;modern cloud architectures&quot; and I see a firehose of raw data being spewed out in hideously inefficient formats. Think 1 kilobyte of JSON to represent a metric, often a single number or data point. It&apos;s not just NetFlix, this is the default for most of Azure Monitor and its agents as an example that would affect a lot of people.The write amplification is just insanity. Orders of magnitude of overhead, not data. It&apos;s as if the entire world forgot that binary formats exist. Google in no small part benefits from remembering this lost art -- they default to gRPC and similar packed binary formats. One reason Kubernetes (written mostly by ex-Googlers) is so fast is because internally it&apos;s all compiled code and gRPC. Compared to, say, Azure itself it is ludicrously faster. Literally hundreds of times lower latencies for common operations. <br></li><li><a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/state-machine-replication-and-why-you-should-care/?ref=highscalability.com">Doug</a>: So this is actually one of the nice things that I also really like about Concord is that if you take a single process and look at it, it&#x2019;s not just a state machine. It&#x2019;s actually a state machine that&#x2019;s composed of smaller state machines who themselves might be composed of smaller state machines. What that means is that you can kind of draw your boundaries in lots of different places. You can take a single program that is maybe performing too slowly and split it into two smaller ones or you can take a swath of programs that all have similar kind of needs in terms of data and stitch them together, and it lets you play with the performance profiles of them in a really nice way. <br></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JW5WQSR/?ref=highscalability.com">The Victorian Internet</a>: the construction of a global telegraph network was widely expected, by Briggs and Maverick among others, to result in world peace: &#x2018;&#x2018;It is impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should longer exist, while such an instrument has been created for the exchange of thought between all the nations of the earth.&#x2019;&#x2019;...So much for universal peace and understanding.

New cables were being laid all over the world. Malta had been linked to Alexandria in 1868, and a direct cable was laid from France to Newfoundland in 1869. Cables reached India, Hong Kong, China, and Japan in 1870; Australia was connected in 1871, and South America in 1874. In 1844, when Morse had started building the network, there were a few dozen miles of wire and sending a message from, say, London to Bombay and back took ten weeks. But within thirty years there were over 650,000 miles of wire, 30,000 miles of submarine cable, and 20,000 towns and villages were on-line&#x2014;and messages could be telegraphed from London to Bombay and back in as little as four minutes. &#x2018;&#x2018;Time itself is telegraphed out of existence,&#x2019;&#x2019; <br></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X47ZVXM?ref=highscalability.com">Cal Newport</a>: The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.

<li>It&apos;s relations all the way down. Carlo Rovelli defined <a href="https://medium.com/predict/carlo-rovellis-relational-quantum-mechanics-256cc264f394?ref=highscalability.com">relational quantum mechanics</a> (RQM) as meaning something like all the properties of a physical object only exists in relation to another physical object. This resonated with me because after years of deep diving into relational and object modeling, I came to a similar conclusion in the realm of software. When I was teaching a relational database class, the typical way of introducing normalization was it&apos;s a way of reducing update anomalies. But when you consider the nature of relations it&apos;s deeper than that. The only thing that holds a relation together is identity. All other properties are a product of some relationship. Even a natural property like created_at is a relationship with time. Same with location, and every other property. In practice, that&apos;s doesn&apos;t matter because in practice relational models are for solving problems, not for plumbing the mysteries of the itness of what something actually is. And if you&apos;ve ever been in a design meeting conversations often turn more into more of a philosophical inquiry than a practical problem solving session. When people say something is &quot;over designed&quot; this is often the reason. We turn design into a psychonalaytic therapy session with our client. We plumb their depths searching for insight. In the end time runs out, so we slap some properties in a table, add some foreign keys, make some queries, and call it a day, knowing that whatever we did missed the mark. Of course the ground shifts later because the model never matches the territory and epicycles keep being added to get the right result as defined by practicality. Object modeling produces the same insights. In an object model what exists is object identity. All other ISA, HASA, USES decisions are ultimately relational. This is also why no two people or groups will produce the same design for the same problem. They&apos;re grabbing different parts of the elephant. This relates to RQM because the&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics?ref=highscalability.com">essential idea behind RQM is that different observers may give different accurate accounts of the same system</a>. Most of what we call technical debt stems from the fact the nothing in software has a true essence. Nothing we build is built on a true and everlasting nature. Our conceit is that we are building something based on a deeper truth, but when we look at something it&apos;s from a prism of relations, none of which are objectively right from a software persepctive. Whole networks of relations shift over time as problems change, people change, technology changes, understanding changes, as everything changes from that heroic point in time a human mind took a stand, created code, and moved on. The antidote is said to be simplicity. But in the same way the Zen and The Art Of Motorcycle Riding rediscovers Taoism through the concept of quality, simplcity is just another relation in the vast possibility space of relations.&#xA0;</li>

<li> Triple OG Stack Overflow still marching to the beat of their own servers. <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/847/engineering-stack-overflow-with-roberta-arcoverde?ref=highscalability.com">Engineering Stack Overflow with Roberta Arcoverde</a>:        
<ul>
<li> 1.3B page views / month </li>
<li> we have a code base that is 14 years old. We run on prem, we run on our own data center. We haven&apos;t gone to the cloud. We also have a monolithic application. So we have not breaking down into services or microservices in. We have a multi-tenant web app.net based, running on a single app, pull across nine web servers only. And that same application single app pool on AIS is handling 6,000 requests per second at the moment </li>
<li> But so far our engineering teams working on the Q and a platform, I think we are at around 50 engineers at this point. </li>
<li> we could, in theory, be running on a single web server. We wouldn&apos;t want to do that, but theoretically it would be possible. </li>
<li> we always start from asking the question, what problem are you trying to solve? And in our, the problems that these tools and bandwagons try to solve are not problems that we were facing ourselves. So when you think about things like a monolith, for example, right? Why do you break down a monolithic to microservices or services typically because you want to scale two separate teams. </li>
<li> You want to have multiple teams working on the same project without stepping on each other tolls. You want to have fast deploys. For example, fast deploys have never been a problem to us. We put stack overflow in production multiple times a day in four minutes. That&apos;s the time it took to build Seco floats abroad. If we had to revert a change, for example, it was always super fast, right? In, in a matter of minutes, we could revert our deployments, even though it is still a monolith, not a bunch of really small applications, but a single big application and invest in efficiency on those things. </li>
<li> And that&apos;s important for keeping in mind that stack flow was built to scale that way. Right? We are designed for low latency. We are designed to grab requests, run them as acute, a few queries and return as soon as possible so that we can pick up the next one. We cannot handle a lot of memory pressure. So we also designed for low allocations everywhere. We try to avoid creating objects that will have to be collected very often. We try to avoid memory pressure on those nine web servers so that we don&apos;t have to stall on garbage collections because a stall and a garbage collect is terrifying for these web servers. So we try to run smooth and with a very low memory footprint, because that&apos;s how that scalability model was designed to work on, on the infrastructure that we have. </li>
<li> 80% of our traffic is anonymous. People go to the question show page, which is the page that we show when you are Googling something and you get a result that takes you directly to stack overflow the solution to your problem, right </li>
<li> we have two different levels of cash on, on the front, right on, on the memory and the web servers. And we also have our SQL server servers. They have 1.5 terabytes of Ram. So a third of the entire database can be very quickly access the in RAM. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcwatt/status/1544876135711916035?ref=highscalability.com">@alexcwatt~</a>: giving SQL more RAM is better than caching page fragments with Redis. </li>
<li> So we removed all cash and that was like three or four years ago. We stopped cashing that page. We stopped caching the content and little did we know it didn&apos;t really make any measurable effects on the performance. We were still able to handle requests and send responses in super fast because of how the architecture was built at the time. So currently for example, the average time to render on that page is around 20 milliseconds. So even without cash. </li>
<li> we did this regular exercise where we would try to understand how much it would cost to run stack overflow in the cloud. And it was just never worth it, which is why we never did it these days. When we think about the cloud, we are thinking less about the power that it would take and more about latency. The other thing that we optimize for a lot with the current design is low latency. So we have an infrastructure that has single hops between nodes and those hops are connected via 10 gigabytes network cables and make Craver will tell you all about it. </li>
<li> Well, pragmatism is what I&apos;m hearing. Just comes down to productivity and pragmatism. Those are the words of the day. </li>
<li> We have rolling builds. So we have those nine web servers. They are under an HTA proxy front, and every time that we need to, to run a new, to deploy a new version of the site, we take a server out of rotation, updated there, put it back on rotation. </li>
<li> Shopify also runs on monolith. <a href="https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity?ref=highscalability.com">Deconstructing the Monolith: Designing Software that Maximizes Developer Productivity</a>. </li>

<li> But Airbnb moved from a monolith to a microservices. Results? Mixed. <a href="https://medium.com/qe-unit/airbnbs-microservices-architecture-journey-to-quality-engineering-d5a490e6ba4f?ref=highscalability.com">Airbnb&#x2019;s Microservices Architecture Journey To Quality Engineering</a>.                                       
<ul>
<li> Main philosophy: architecture can&apos;t impact business growth. </li>
<li> 2008-2017. They used a monolith and monorepo until they reached about $2.6B in revenue, so you have some runway before you need to switch. At first, small teams worked on features with limited dependencies. </li>
<li> What problems did they have?  Velocity of software changes decreased. Hard to work on features in parallel. Component ownership is confused. </li>
<li> 2017-2020. Microservices. The monorepo was split with a dedicated service migration team responsible for component transition. Yes, it helps to have resources. </li>
<li> They reached $5B in revenue, but features are a cross-cutting concern, so implementing a feature required changes in multiple services involving multiple teams. Fine-grained services distributes complexity across services, make it hard to collaborate across teams, and even small changes are disruptive. </li>
<li> Thrift was replaced by GraphQL as a unified data access layer. Annotations and codegen were used to improve the code. Love me some codegen. </li>
<li> 2020- present. Micro + Macroservices. </li>
<li> The main changes were unified APIs, central data aggregator, and service block facade APIs. It&apos;s not exactly clear what this means at a code and team level. </li>
<li> At this point people will say the problem was they weren&apos;t doing microservices right. This is the self-fulfilling prophecy problem every philosophy has. If it didn&apos;t work, you weren&apos;t doing it right. In practice right-sizing services is always a problem because there are rarely natural service boundaries. </li>
<li> Keep in mind a monolith should still be service based on the inside, it shouldn&apos;t just be a tangle of code. So in theory taking monolith should be just taking those already existing service point APIs and making them remote. Ownership or lack thereof wouldn&apos;t have to change. And I think the monorepo is a misdirection. What matters is code organization, the number of repos means nothing.</li>

<li> Which cloud rules them all?                                       
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/2022-cloud-report?ref=highscalability.com">Cockroach Labs 2022 Cloud Report</a> the answer is&#x2026;nobody.  All three cloud providers offer price-competitive options. While there are no winners, they have some good advice on making choices: </li>
<li> Thanks to AMD, GCP and Azure instances are outpacing AWS instances. GCP&#x2019;s t2d instance type (which uses AMD Milan processors) took the top overall spot for both large and small nodes in our OLTP testing. </li>
<li>For even relatively small amounts of persistent block storage, the cost of running a particular workload is much more influenced by the cost of the storage than it is the cost of the instance. For persistent workloads, it is extremely important to optimize cost calculations based on this consideration. This means preferring mid-tier storage options (pd-ssd on GCP, gp3 on AWS, premium-disk on Azure) unless your workload requires an either extremely high number of IOPS or very low storage latency. </li>
<li> In both the OLTP and CPU benchmarks, we saw a per-vCPU performance advantage to running on smaller instances of a particular instance type, regardless of CPU platform, cloud, or instance type. </li>
<li> while you may save a bit of money by choosing instance types with a lower vCPU to RAM ratio, you will likely see more consistent performance from instance types with more available memory, at least for the purposes of running CockroachDB. </li>
<li> How do their oligopic pricing policies compare? <a href="https://cast.ai/blog/cloud-pricing-comparison-aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-platform/?ref=highscalability.com">Cloud Pricing Comparison: AWS vs. Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform in 2022</a>.

What little I&apos;ve seen from Azure toward customers can best be characterized as &quot;inaction&quot;. AWS has the most interesting--and rare!--approach to customer feedback of all. </li>
<li> <a href="https://danielcompton.net/penny-wise-cloud-foolish?ref=highscalability.com">Daniel Compton</a>: The main alignment here is Google adding data transfer charges to match AWS and breaking architectural promises they&#x2019;ve made to their customers in the process.

<ul>
<li> we rely on edge computing, where we bring the cloud gaming infrastructure closer to players by deploying in edges that are in metropolitan areas close to large populations. </li>
<li> we partnered with NVIDIA to build a hosting environment on top of NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs </li>
<li> we use Twine, our cluster management system, on top of our edge computing operating system. We build orchestration services to manage the streaming signals and use Twine to coordinate the game servers on edge. </li>
<li> We built and used container technologies for both Windows and Android games. </li>
<li> we landed on WebRTC with Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) technology as our solution to streaming user inputs and video/audio frames for games. </li>
<li> Whenever a player clicked to perform an action in a game (e.g., to make their character jump), we captured the click event and sent it to the server, where the game received the event. The game then rendered a frame that contained the result of that action (i.e., the character jumping). We captured that rendered frame, copied it out, and encoded it using a video encoder. The frame was then packetized so it could fit into a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet and sent through the network to the player. Finally, on the player&#x2019;s side, there was a jitter buffer to help smooth play as the packets came in. We decoded the packets into frames, then rendered the frame for the player. Our current model significantly improves on this and improves latency using GPU encoding. </li>
<li> On the networking side, having edge computing sites close to the player also helps reduce video and audio latency &#x2014; even more significantly than the savings from moving the entire streaming pipeline to GPUs. </li>
<li> Over on the player side, we also now use hardware decoding to reduce the decode time. </li>

<li> The design seems to be very narrowly targeted at maximizing compute density in the cloud. To that end, AWS has chosen very conservative core clocks. At 2.6 GHz, Graviton 3 clocks a mere 100 MHz over its predecessor, Graviton 2&#x2026;Such a core running at 2.6 GHz on 5 nm should absolutely sip power. That in turn lets AWS pack three of these chips into a single node, increasing compute density.

<ul>
<li> Pinterest leverages both synthetic load generation and production shadow traffic to evaluate the impact of tuning and optimizations. </li>
<li> While memcached can be arbitrarily horizontally scaled in and out to address a particular cluster&#x2019;s bottleneck, vertically scaling individual hardware dimensions allows for greater cost efficiency for specific workloads. </li>
<li> using extstore to expand storage capacity beyond DRAM into a local NVMe flash disk tier increases per-instance storage efficiency by up to several orders of magnitude, and it reduces the associated cluster cost footprint proportionally. </li>
<li> Approximately half of all caching workloads at Pinterest are compute-bound (i.e. purely request throughput-bound). Successful optimizations in compute efficiency translate into the ability to downsize clusters without compromising serving capacity. </li>
<li> At Pinterest, most workloads (including the distributed cache fleet) run on dedicated EC2 virtual machines. </li>
<li> running memcached under a real-time scheduling policy, SCHED_FIFO, with a high priority &#x2014; instructing the kernel to, effectively, allow memcached to monopolize the CPU by preempting. This one-line change, after rollout to all compute-bound clusters, drove client-side P99 latency down by anywhere between 10% and 40%, in addition to eliminating spurious spikes in P99 and P999 latency across the board. </li>
<li> TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a mechanism for reducing the latency overhead of establishing a TCP connection by optimizing away one RTT in an otherwise costly TCP 3WHS (3-way handshake), while also allowing eager transmission of early data during the handshake itself. </li>

<li> New World became the fifth highest-played game by concurrent users in the history of the video game distribution service Steam, with more than 900,000 concurrent users in its first weekend. </li>
<li> Amazon DynamoDB handles about 800,000 writes every 30 seconds to store game state. </li>
<li> While a traditional MMO simulates, redraws, analyzes, and processes user states and actions around five times per second, New World does these 30 times a second. &quot;In the old world, if things needed to scale up, you bought bigger hardware&quot; </li>
<li> As a player moves through the game, state information is handed from hub instance to hub instance, spreading the compute load over virtual servers hosted globally in multiple AWS Regions, physical locations that contain clusters of data centers. </li>
<li> the Amazon EC2 instances for a single world in Aeternum can simulate more than 7,000 artificial intelligence entities and hundreds of thousands of objects for 2,500 players. Each server set often processes millions of state changes per second, </li>

<ul>
<li> Uber infrastructure operates in multiple zones in multiple regions, across both on-prem data centers and public cloud providers. Most of the control plane components are zonal, and each typically consists of several sub-components. At a very high level, Uber&#x2019;s service mesh architecture is centered around an on-host L7 reverse proxy </li>
<li> Subsetting in the context of load balancing means dividing the set of potential backend tasks into overlapping &quot;subsets,&quot; so that while all backends receive traffic in aggregate, each proxy performs the load balancing on a limited set of tasks. </li>
<li> The basic idea is: if an on-host proxy knows how much QPS a callee service is receiving, it could derive the ratio of load it is contributing to the overall traffic. With this information, an on-host proxy could decide its subsetting size dynamically based on ratio ( i.e., it should expand its subsetting size if it starts to make more requests to a destination service). </li>
<li> Dynamic Subsetting system where aperture parameters of the mesh scale automatically and dynamically with the changing traffic. The system has been running in production for nearly 2 years for millions of containers. </li>
<li> The primary success we&#x2019;d like to call out is the reduction in maintenance cost: since the rollout (~18-12 months ago) we have had 0 cases of service owners complaining about subsetting. With 8 larger services manually tuned, they reported 15-30% p99 CPU utilization reduction. </li>

<ul>
<li> A cascading failure is a failure that increases in size over time due to a positive feedback loop. The typical behavior is initially triggered by a single node or subsystem failing. This spreads the load across fewer nodes of the remaining system, which in turn increases the likelihood of further system failures resulting in a vicious circle or snowball effect </li>
<li> The most common cause is server overload or a consequence of it. When that happens, the drop in system performance often affects other areas of the system. </li>
<li> Resources of a server are limited. If the load increases above a certain threshold, the server&#x2019;s performance metrics, such as latency or error rates, deteriorate. This translates into a higher risk of a crash </li>
<li> When resource exhaustion causes a server to crash, traffic spreads to other servers, increasing the likelihood that those will crash as well. A cycle of crashing servers establishes. </li>
<li> Now, to address the cascading scenario, various measures can be taken. The first and most intuitive option is to increase resources. </li>
<li> Try to avoid health check failures/deaths </li>
<li> Restart your servers in case of thread-blocking requests or deadlocks. </li>
<li> Drop traffic significantly and then slowly increase the load so that the servers can gradually recover. </li>
<li> Switch to a degraded mode by dropping certain types of traffic. </li>
<li> Eliminate batch/bad traffic to reduce system load </li>
