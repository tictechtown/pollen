<p>Wow, five hundred issues!  I sent <a href="https://sreweekly.com/sre-weekly-issue-1/">the first issue of SRE Weekly</a> out almost exactly ten years ago.  I assumed my little experiment would fairly quickly come to an end when I exhausted the supply of SRE-related articles.</p>



<p>I needn&#8217;t have worried.  Somehow, the authors I&#8217;ve featured here have continued to produce a seemingly endless stream of excellent articles.  If anything, the pace has only picked up over time!  A profound thank you to all of the authors, without whom this newsletter would be just an empty bulleted list.</p>



<p>And thanks to you, dear readers, for making this worthwhile.  Thanks for sharing the articles you find or write, I love receiving them!  Thanks for the notes you send after an issue you particularly like, and the corrections too.  Thanks for your kind well-wishes for my recent surgery, they meant a ton.</p>



<p>Finally, thanks to my sponsors, whose support makes all this possible.  If you see something interesting, please give it a click and check it out!</p>
