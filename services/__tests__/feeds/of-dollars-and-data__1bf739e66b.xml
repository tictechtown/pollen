					<description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, Michael Green <a href="https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-1-my-life-is-a-lie">published a post</a> where he argued that the poverty line for a family of four in the U.S. wasn't $32,100 in annual income (<a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/">as currently claimed by the Department of Health and Human Services</a>), but closer to $140,000 per year.

He maintains that how poverty was determined historically (based solely on food prices) no longer holds because the costs of other necessities (namely housing, healthcare, and childcare) have gone up considerably. Therefore, a typical family of four needs far more income to participate in society today than they would've needed a few decades ago.

I believe that this thesis is fundamentally correct and the real poverty line is much higher than the $32,100 figure provided by the DHHS. However, how Green goes from this correct diagnosis to a revised $140,000 per year "poverty line" is flawed in many ways.

I have no interest in taking apart the $140,000 figure because others have <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-140000-poverty-line-is-very-silly">thoroughly debunked it already</a>, and even Green himself <a href="https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-2-the-door-has-opened">revised it down to $94,000 one week later</a>. That alone should illustrate how outlandish his original $140k poverty line estimate was.

However, even Green's more reasonable $94,000 poverty line for a family of four is still slightly exaggerated. The problem with this number isn't the data Green uses, but how he applies it.

Ironically, Green bashes economists for championing rising home prices and 401(k) balances as signs of improving wealth, but, with similar naiveté, assumes that everyone <em>pays the average price</em> for all their goods and services. But they don't. In the real world, the costs associated with things like childcare and housing vary significantly and can be much lower than <em>the average</em>.&nbsp;

For example, I know a woman who is unmarried with three children. Her and her boyfriend both work and they each make less than $20 an hour. As a result, their household income is less than $80,000 per year.

According to Green, this family would be struggling just trying to keep up with their childcare costs. Is that what happens in practice? No. When their children aren't in school, they stay with the woman's mother. So that hypothetical $32,000 in childcare costs (for two children) goes to $0 (for three children). While not everyone has this luxury, millions do, and a poverty metric that ignores the informal economy overlooks how the working class actually survives.

More importantly, if she didn't have her mother there, she could consider other relatives to watch her kids or pay someone to watch them for far less than $32,000 per year.&nbsp;Most people aren't isolated economic units. They exist within a broader network of friends and family that can provide real economic value that offsets some of these costs.

I understand that this is just one anecdote, but it exemplifies the logical flaw in Green's argument. He assumes that people will willingly go to work, earn a low wage, and then spend it all on childcare (i.e., pay the average price). No, they won't! If the second earner doesn't make enough, they will stay home and watch the kids. Or they will only work part time (nights/weekends). Or they will find a cheaper childcare arrangement.

This demonstrates that there's a big difference between the <i>formal</i> market and the <i>informal</i> market, especially for childcare. Green's analysis assumes that everyone pays the sticker price at a licensed daycare center (i.e., the formal market). But in reality, millions of families operate in the informal market, utilizing grandparents, neighbors, or split-shifts to reduce their childcare cost significantly.

The same logic applies for housing as well. For example, the average price for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City <a href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/new-york-ny/">is around $4,000</a>. If we assumed that everyone in NYC paid <em>that price</em> for housing, then it would be easy to argue that lots of people in NYC are in deep poverty.

However, if you actually look at the data, the <em>median</em> rent paid for an apartment in NYC is <a href="https://www.maximumnewyork.com/p/nycs-median-rent-is-16k-and-how-that">only $1,650 per month across 2.3 million rental units</a>. How is that possible? Because this figure includes rent-stabilized units, rent-controlled units, and public housing units which are much cheaper than market rate apartments. When we use the <em>average</em> market rate, we skew this number upward and exclude over half of NYC's housing stock.

And that's just what's in the formal housing market. There are many informal housing arrangements that fly below the radar that are much cheaper as well. For example, one of my wife's friends shares a room in Brooklyn with two other people and only pays $500 a month. While this is a bit extreme, she's living in Brooklyn for only $500 a month! These kinds of housing situations are unlikely to be in the data, but they exist nonetheless.

I understand that the NYC housing market is very different from the rest of the U.S., but it demonstrates that housing options are far more diverse than what "the average" suggests. The same goes for childcare.

As a result, many families can get by on much less than what Green assumes. Does that mean that the poverty line for a family of four is only $32,100? No. It's definitely more than double that.

But is that really a surprise? If low skilled workers now earn $20 an hour (~$40,000 per year), is it unreasonable to expect people to earn more than that to raise a family of four?&nbsp; I don't know. Unfortunately, questions like this are more ethical than financial in nature, which isn't my area of expertise.

Regardless of what you believe about the <em>true</em> poverty line, it's fair to say that it's far below $140,000. And Michael Green knows that.

The real genius of his article was saying something blatantly true <em>and</em> blatantly false at the same time. This is how you maximize engagement and go viral.

Why does this work? Because it gets those who believe the truth to come out and support you and those who think it's false to come out against you. For example, consider this image I saw on LinkedIn recently:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tipping_too_much.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30972" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tipping_too_much.jpg" alt="If you cant tip your server don't go out to eat. And then proceeds to show that someone should tip 40% on their bill." width="400" height="533"></a>

This is incredible engagement bait because it says something true ("If you can't tip your server, don't go out to eat") and something false ("You should tip your server 40%") at the same time. Max outrage. Max engagement. Rinse. Repeat.

This is basically what Green did in his original article and it worked. Multiple readers asked me about it, so I felt like I had to respond.

Green is far smarter than me and I have nothing against him. Even though I disagree with his long-held stance that <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/is-there-a-problem-with-passive-investing/">passive indexing is in a massive bubble</a>, he's a great thinker.

However, people are also more complicated than Green assumes. For example, you can run the numbers and declare that someone will run out of money in retirement using <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/">the 4% Rule</a>, but they probably won't. In practice, they will cut back as their assets decline. They will change their behavior. They will adapt.

This explains why <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-do-retirees-actually-spend-their-money/">so few people actually use the 4% Rule</a>. It's too robotic to fit actual human behavior. However, it's a great convenience for investment nerds like myself and Green.&nbsp;

But convenience doesn't equal truth, whether we look at the 4% Rule or the poverty line. Thank you for reading.

					<description><![CDATA[With 2025 coming to an end, it’s time for my annual tradition of gathering my favorite investment writing of the year. I started this tradition in <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2017/">2017</a>, and have continued it ever since (<a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2018/">2018</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2019/">2019</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2020/">2020</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2021/">2021</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2022/">2022</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2023/">2023</a>, <a style="color: blue; "href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2024/">2024</a>).

2025 was a year of turbulence (in April) <em>and</em> a year of growth. And though <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/there-is-no-substitute-for-thinking/">AI has infiltrated the writing space like never before</a>, there are still many great <em>human</em> writers doing their thing. With that being said, I present my favorite investment writing of 2025:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/on-bubble-watch">On Bubble Watch</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights">Howard Marks</a>)</li>
</ul>
Howard Marks is one of the best investment writers and thinkers in our industry and this piece (which came out in early 2025) set the stage for many of the bubble discussions <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-im-bearish-on-us-stocks-for-the-second-time-since-2017/">that followed</a> throughout the year. While Marks doesn't adamantly claim that everything is in a bubble, he does provide measured evidence illustrating how valuations seem stretched in today's environment. A great read to orient yourself as we go into 2026.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.downtownjoshbrown.com/p/why-be-an-lp-when-you-can-be-a-gp">Why be an LP when you can be a GP? </a></strong>(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/downtownjoshbrown/?hl=en">Josh Brown</a>)</li>
</ul>
While Marks was discussing the possibility of a bubble in public markets, Josh Brown penned this wonderful article on what's happening in private markets. Similarly, Josh doesn't claim that private equity is bad or in a huge bubble, but rather highlights what Wall Street has done to get more investors into this historically exclusive asset class. Filled with humor and wit in equal measure, this piece is for anyone who wants to know what's been happening in private markets.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://moneywithkatie.com/essays/americas-housing-paradox-hiding-in-plain-sight/">America's Housing Paradox, Hiding in Plain Sight</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/moneywithkatie/">Money With Katie</a>)</li>
</ul>
There were a lot of housing posts published in 2025, but this one had the most in-depth research of any I read. Quite simply, Katie Gatti Tassin <em>crushed</em> it here. If you want to know why the U.S. has a housing crisis and why it probably won't be solved anytime soon, read this piece.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/03/when-will-housing-prices-fall/">When Will Housing Prices Fall?</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/awealthofcs">Ben Carlson</a>)</li>
</ul>
Every year I put a Ben Carlson housing piece on this list because every year he delivers. This year Ben asks, "When will housing prices fall?" and then answers the question with solid data and analysis. There's a reason Ben is the best housing writer in our space, and this piece illustrates why.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://collabfund.com/blog/pure-independence/"><b>Pure Independence</b></a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/morganhousel" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Housel</a>)</li>
</ul>
You can tell when a writer is passionate about a topic and it clearly shows here for Morgan. Not only does he define different forms of independence and why they matter, but he also demonstrates why independence is the key to producing great work. A must read for anyone trying to live life on their own terms.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://newsletter.thewayofwork.com/p/career-leverage?r=5bzu0a&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Why you probably have a low leverage career (and how to create more leverage)</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@rickfoerster">Rick Foerster</a>)</li>
</ul>
I discovered Rick Foerster rather recently and loved this piece on career leverage. I've <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-4-types-of-leverage/">written on leverage before</a>, but this guide from Rick is far more detailed and provides a lot more high-leverage options for those looking to transform their career. If you want to understand how to earn more in the future via leverage, this is the piece to read.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.theirrelevantinvestor.com/p/how-does-the-stock-market-bottom-bf3d">How Does the Stock Market Bottom?</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbatnick">Michael Batnick</a>)</li>
</ul>
Every time the market crashes, Michael Batnick produces his absolute best work. The calm and collected tone during the high uncertainty back in April was something every investor needed to hear. And while the market turbulence has since passed, this is a good reminder on how the stock market tends to bottom before things get better.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/what-now-an-investors-to-do-list-chaotic-markets">What Now? An Investor’s To-Do List for Chaotic Markets</a></strong> (<a href="https://x.com/christine_benz">Christine Benz</a>)</li>
</ul>
Right as the market crashed in April, Christine Benz came out with this simple, yet effective reminder on what things to do during a chaotic market. This was not a piece on market timing, but a gentle reminder to have your affairs in order in case things got worse. An evergreen read whether we are experiencing a chaotic market or not.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.fortunesandfrictions.com/post/perspectives-on-market-downturns">Perspective on Market Downturns </a></strong>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubinmiller/">Rubin Miller, CFA</a>)</li>
</ul>
Rubin Miller came out with this wonderful piece one month <em>before</em> the market crashed back in April, but it was timely nonetheless. It reads like a greatest hits of Miller's ideas on volatility, rebalancing, and much more. If you want a broader perspective on managing your portfolio during market downturns, check this one out.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.optimisticallie.com/p/invest-like-buffett">Invest Like Buffett</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://x.com/callieabost">Callie Cox</a>)</li>
</ul>
Shortly after Warren Buffett announced that he was stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway, Callie Cox wrote this great article. Not only was it an ode to Buffett and his legacy, but it provides real-world takeaways on how to invest more like the Oracle of Omaha. Though the advice is deceptively simple, a periodic reminder doesn't hurt.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/giving-people-money-helped-less-than">Giving people money helped less than I thought it would</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@kelseytuoc">Kelsey Piper</a>)</li>
</ul>
I love evidence-based financial writing and Kelsey Piper delivers it in this one on the effectiveness of universal basic income (UBI). Historically, I was a fan of UBI, but after reading this piece it seems like the result is less promising than I would've hoped. An incredible read for anyone trying to understand where UBI helps people...and where it doesn't.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/whos-getting-rich-off-your-attention">Who's Getting Rich Off Your Attention</a></strong> (<a href="https://x.com/kylascan">Kyla Scanlon</a>)</li>
</ul>
Though Kyla Scanlon is more of an economics writer, I had to include her work here because she is writing on the very topics that are impacting markets and our day-to-day lives. This one takes an in-depth look at how companies get rich off of our attention and how that landscape has evolved over the past decade. A must read for anyone trying to understand the impact of social media on our lives.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://oldcoinbad.com/p/long-degeneracy">long degeneracy</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@oldcoinbad">jez</a>)</li>

I don't usually read about cryptocurrency and other forms of speculation, but this piece by "jez" is simply fantastic. Whether we like it or not, speculation is a large part of the investment space and this post explains why. While I don't agree with everything written here, it's a must read for those who want to know more about the non-traditional world of finance.

</ul>
This post isn't about investing per se, but it tackles the topics of life, death, and decision-making in an incredible way. Zweig does a great job examining Daniel Kahneman's final decision to end his life and the impact this decision had on Kahneman's friends, family, and extended community.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[With 2025 coming to an end, it’s time for my annual tradition of gathering my favorite investment writing of the year. I started this tradition in <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2017/">2017</a>, and have continued it ever since (<a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2018/">2018</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2019/">2019</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2020/">2020</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2021/">2021</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2022/">2022</a>, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2023/">2023</a>, <a style="color: blue; "href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-favorite-investment-writing-of-2024/">2024</a>).

2025 was a year of turbulence (in April) <em>and</em> a year of growth. And though <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/there-is-no-substitute-for-thinking/">AI has infiltrated the writing space like never before</a>, there are still many great <em>human</em> writers doing their thing. With that being said, I present my favorite investment writing of 2025:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/on-bubble-watch">On Bubble Watch</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights">Howard Marks</a>)</li>
</ul>
Howard Marks is one of the best investment writers and thinkers in our industry and this piece (which came out in early 2025) set the stage for many of the bubble discussions <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-im-bearish-on-us-stocks-for-the-second-time-since-2017/">that followed</a> throughout the year. While Marks doesn't adamantly claim that everything is in a bubble, he does provide measured evidence illustrating how valuations seem stretched in today's environment. A great read to orient yourself as we go into 2026.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.downtownjoshbrown.com/p/why-be-an-lp-when-you-can-be-a-gp">Why be an LP when you can be a GP? </a></strong>(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/downtownjoshbrown/?hl=en">Josh Brown</a>)</li>
</ul>
While Marks was discussing the possibility of a bubble in public markets, Josh Brown penned this wonderful article on what's happening in private markets. Similarly, Josh doesn't claim that private equity is bad or in a huge bubble, but rather highlights what Wall Street has done to get more investors into this historically exclusive asset class. Filled with humor and wit in equal measure, this piece is for anyone who wants to know what's been happening in private markets.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://moneywithkatie.com/essays/americas-housing-paradox-hiding-in-plain-sight/">America's Housing Paradox, Hiding in Plain Sight</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/moneywithkatie/">Money With Katie</a>)</li>
</ul>
There were a lot of housing posts published in 2025, but this one had the most in-depth research of any I read. Quite simply, Katie Gatti Tassin <em>crushed</em> it here. If you want to know why the U.S. has a housing crisis and why it probably won't be solved anytime soon, read this piece.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/03/when-will-housing-prices-fall/">When Will Housing Prices Fall?</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/awealthofcs">Ben Carlson</a>)</li>
</ul>
Every year I put a Ben Carlson housing piece on this list because every year he delivers. This year Ben asks, "When will housing prices fall?" and then answers the question with solid data and analysis. There's a reason Ben is the best housing writer in our space, and this piece illustrates why.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://collabfund.com/blog/pure-independence/"><b>Pure Independence</b></a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/morganhousel" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Housel</a>)</li>
</ul>
You can tell when a writer is passionate about a topic and it clearly shows here for Morgan. Not only does he define different forms of independence and why they matter, but he also demonstrates why independence is the key to producing great work. A must read for anyone trying to live life on their own terms.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://newsletter.thewayofwork.com/p/career-leverage?r=5bzu0a&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Why you probably have a low leverage career (and how to create more leverage)</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@rickfoerster">Rick Foerster</a>)</li>
</ul>
I discovered Rick Foerster rather recently and loved this piece on career leverage. I've <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-4-types-of-leverage/">written on leverage before</a>, but this guide from Rick is far more detailed and provides a lot more high-leverage options for those looking to transform their career. If you want to understand how to earn more in the future via leverage, this is the piece to read.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.theirrelevantinvestor.com/p/how-does-the-stock-market-bottom-bf3d">How Does the Stock Market Bottom?</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbatnick">Michael Batnick</a>)</li>
</ul>
Every time the market crashes, Michael Batnick produces his absolute best work. The calm and collected tone during the high uncertainty back in April was something every investor needed to hear. And while the market turbulence has since passed, this is a good reminder on how the stock market tends to bottom before things get better.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/what-now-an-investors-to-do-list-chaotic-markets">What Now? An Investor’s To-Do List for Chaotic Markets</a></strong> (<a href="https://x.com/christine_benz">Christine Benz</a>)</li>
</ul>
Right as the market crashed in April, Christine Benz came out with this simple, yet effective reminder on what things to do during a chaotic market. This was not a piece on market timing, but a gentle reminder to have your affairs in order in case things got worse. An evergreen read whether we are experiencing a chaotic market or not.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.fortunesandfrictions.com/post/perspectives-on-market-downturns">Perspective on Market Downturns </a></strong>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubinmiller/">Rubin Miller, CFA</a>)</li>
</ul>
Rubin Miller came out with this wonderful piece one month <em>before</em> the market crashed back in April, but it was timely nonetheless. It reads like a greatest hits of Miller's ideas on volatility, rebalancing, and much more. If you want a broader perspective on managing your portfolio during market downturns, check this one out.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.optimisticallie.com/p/invest-like-buffett">Invest Like Buffett</a></strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://x.com/callieabost">Callie Cox</a>)</li>
</ul>
Shortly after Warren Buffett announced that he was stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway, Callie Cox wrote this great article. Not only was it an ode to Buffett and his legacy, but it provides real-world takeaways on how to invest more like the Oracle of Omaha. Though the advice is deceptively simple, a periodic reminder doesn't hurt.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/giving-people-money-helped-less-than">Giving people money helped less than I thought it would</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@kelseytuoc">Kelsey Piper</a>)</li>
</ul>
I love evidence-based financial writing and Kelsey Piper delivers it in this one on the effectiveness of universal basic income (UBI). Historically, I was a fan of UBI, but after reading this piece it seems like the result is less promising than I would've hoped. An incredible read for anyone trying to understand where UBI helps people...and where it doesn't.&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/whos-getting-rich-off-your-attention">Who's Getting Rich Off Your Attention</a></strong> (<a href="https://x.com/kylascan">Kyla Scanlon</a>)</li>
</ul>
Though Kyla Scanlon is more of an economics writer, I had to include her work here because she is writing on the very topics that are impacting markets and our day-to-day lives. This one takes an in-depth look at how companies get rich off of our attention and how that landscape has evolved over the past decade. A must read for anyone trying to understand the impact of social media on our lives.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://oldcoinbad.com/p/long-degeneracy">long degeneracy</a></strong> (<a href="https://substack.com/@oldcoinbad">jez</a>)</li>
</ul>
I don't usually read about cryptocurrency and other forms of speculation, but this piece by "jez" is simply fantastic. Whether we like it or not, speculation is a large part of the investment space and this post explains why. While I don't agree with everything written here, it's a must read for those who want to know more about the non-traditional world of finance.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/daniel-kahneman-assisted-suicide-9fb16124">The Last Decision by the World's Leading Thinker on Decisions</a> </strong>(<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonzweigwsj">Jason Zweig</a>)</li>
</ul>
This post isn't about investing per se, but it tackles the topics of life, death, and decision-making in an incredible way. Zweig does a great job examining Daniel Kahneman's final decision to end his life and the impact this decision had on Kahneman's friends, family, and extended community.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a style="color: blue;" href="https://humbledollar.com/forum/farewell-friends/">Farewell Friends</a> </strong>(<a href="https://humbledollar.com/author/jonathan-clements/">Jonathan Clements</a>)</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, we lost a legend of financial writing in 2025—Jonathan Clements. Clements was known for his simple, clear communication around money and I enjoyed many of <a href="https://amzn.to/3XZP1dk">his books</a>. "Farewell Friends" was Clements' last blog post. May he rest in peace.

					<description><![CDATA[I can't stand AI-assisted writing anymore. It's all over Substack. It's in my LinkedIn replies. It's everywhere. Like a disease slowly infecting our literary consciousness. I even see it from people who I <em>know</em> aren't bad writers. For example, a prominent person in the wealth management space recently posted the following:
<blockquote>Your dollar lost 53% of its purchasing power over the past 30 years.
That’s not an anomaly.
That’s the system.
Inflation isn’t just a number - it’s a silent thief.</blockquote>
There's nothing wrong with this message (I agree with it), but it's clearly written by AI. The "It's not X, it's Y" motif is the clearest giveaway of AI-assisted writing, especially <em>when that motif is repeated back to back</em>. The message might as well say "It's not human, it's AI."

But here's the crazy part—even the people complaining about AI are using it in their writing! I was recently reading an article from a history professor about how all of his students use AI to write their essays. As he stated:
<blockquote>I largely receive 400 variations on the same essay. The wording, structure, transitions, tone, even the closing sentences are largely identical.</blockquote>
But then <em>the very next line</em> reads:
<blockquote>This isn’t about a few students cheating. It’s about the collapse of an entire pedagogical model. The mass lecture, the take-home prompt, the standardized rubric—all built for a world that no longer exists.

What AI has done is not simply make cheating easier; it has made my entire form of assessment obsolete.</blockquote>
It's the classic "It's not X, it's Y" motif followed by a list of three items with the em-dash (another AI writing tactic) and finally closing with <em>another</em> "It's not X, it's Y" style line.

Excuse my language, but what the hell is going on?

If the history professor complaining about AI-assisted writing is passing off AI-assisted writing as his own, we're cooked. If the ultra-successful wealth management professional can't help but use AI (or have his social media team use AI), we're done.

Don't get me wrong, using the "It's not X, it's Y" style is not <em>always</em> indicative of AI-assisted writing. But when you see it so many times in the same piece, it's obvious. Why do people post stuff like this? Do they think no one will notice?

I'm not here to bash anyone in particular (which is why I didn't link to the original posts above). However, I'm disappointed in how much AI has infiltrated the writing space.

This is what it must have felt like for natural bodybuilders when anabolic steroids showed up on the scene. AI is a performance-enhancing drug for mediocre writers. And, like bodybuilders on steroids, it leaves behind obvious clues when used.

But using AI isn't the core issue. How people use AI is. The root of this problem is that no one wants to <em>think</em> anymore. They want to outsource their thinking to machines. And, once you start doing that, it's hard to stop.

Trust me, I know the feeling. In early 2023 I used AI to help me write about various topics for SEO purposes. And it worked! My search engine traffic went up 6x from the beginning of 2023.

But, within a few months, I had to stop. As <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/only-the-passionate-survive/">I publicly admitted</a>, writing for a search engine was soul-killing work. I wasn't writing for me, I was writing for an algorithm.&nbsp;To get my passion for writing back, I had to start thinking for myself again.

I know how tempting it is to have AI write an entire article for you. After all, writing is cognitively demanding. It would be so much easier to just "push the AI button" and watch it do its work. But you have to fight that urge. Because once you cross that line, your writing dies. And your soul dies with it.

More importantly, you have to fight back because this is the last edge you will have. As more and more people outsource their cognition to AI, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think they are going to be smarter? Do you think they are going to be more knowledgeable?

Not a chance. In fact, the opposite is already happening. A recent scandal broke out at UC San Diego (UCSD) after <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/740347/sawg-report-on-admissions-review-docs.pdf">it was revealed</a> that the number of students whose math skills fall below middle-school level "increased nearly thirtyfold, reaching roughly one in eight members of the entering cohort." Shockingly, 25% of students in UCSD's remedial math course got the following question wrong:
<blockquote>Fill in the box: 7 + 2 = ☐ + 6</blockquote>
It's 3. There's no gotcha here. 7 + 2 = 3 + 6.

If this is happening at UCSD, which is a great school, imagine what's happening elsewhere.

We don't have to imagine though because the data paints a clear picture. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/us/12th-grade-reading-skills-low-naep.html">the <em>New York Times</em> recently reported</a>, high school seniors had the worst reading scores since 1992 and the worst math scores since 2005. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/low-performing-students-reasons.html">many possible reasons for this</a>, and the heavy reliance on AI isn't helping.

College students in particular use AI at exceedingly high rates. This chart <a href="https://sherwood.news/tech/chatgpt-use-is-picking-up-again-just-as-students-head-back-to-school/">from Sherwood News</a> illustrates how ChatGPT use drops off as college students leave school for the summer (in early June) and then starts to pick up again as they return (in late August):

<a href="http://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-09-01-chatgpt-use-final.avif"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30863" src="http://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-09-01-chatgpt-use-final.avif" alt="ChatGPT usage by month." width="600" height="600"></a>

ChatGPT usage by itself isn't a problem. But when <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/159700143">so many educators are complaining</a> about the rapid decline in cognition among college students, it is.

I'm not saying this to complain about the next generation. I'm saying it because it foreshadows what could happen to the rest of us if we aren't careful. The more we rely on AI to do our cognitive tasks, the more we will mentally atrophy.

<strong>Unfortunately, there is no substitute for thinking.&nbsp;</strong>

This will be as true today as it is in a decade. While the AI tools will get "smarter" at various tasks, outsourcing everything to them will only make you more vulnerable. As the American journalist Sydney J. Harris once said:
<blockquote>The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers.</blockquote>
This is why thinking is the last edge we have. Because while everyone else is having AI draft their emails, write their code, and plan their lives, those who still dare to do <em>some</em> of the mental work themselves will win out.&nbsp;

As the proverb goes, "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."

					<description><![CDATA[Imagine it's 2004 and I explain to you what a mortgage-backed security (MBS) is. I show you how they work and how banks are using them to sell groups of mortgages to investors. Even with this knowledge, it would've been difficult to foresee the financial crisis MBS would help create in just a few years time. After all, there's nothing particularly dangerous about MBS. They weren't new either. The first MBS <a href="https://business.purdue.edu/faculty/mcconnell/publications/The-Origins-and-Evolution-of-the-Market.pdf">was issued in 1968</a>.

But as lending standards loosened in the 2000s, riskier mortgages were underwritten, packaged, and sold (as AAA rated MBS) to unsuspecting investors. This once harmless structure became the catalyst for a financial meltdown.

Well, the year is 2025 and I think I've found the MBS of our era. It's called conduit debt financing.
<h2>Conduit Debt Financing = The New MBS?</h2>
I first heard of conduit debt financing through Matt Levine's piece about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-10-29/put-the-data-center-in-the-box?embedded-checkout=true">how big tech companies are paying for their data center build outs</a>. I've since read <a href="https://lesbarclays.substack.com/p/the-mechanics-of-conduit-debt-financing">this excellent primer</a> on the topic as well. Here's a simplified version of how conduit debt financing works:
<ul>
 	<li>A tech company wants to build a data center, but they don't want to use their cash to pay for it.</li>
 	<li>Instead of borrowing the money directly (which could harm their credit rating), the tech company creates a new company, called a special purpose vehicle (SPV).</li>
 	<li>This SPV borrows the money from investors, builds the data center, and then leases the data center back to the tech company.</li>
 	<li>If the tech company ever fails to pay the SPV, the SPV keeps the data center as collateral.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
In short, the tech company gets its data center without the debt and investors get a highly productive asset. What's not to like?&nbsp;

Like MBS, there's nothing inherently dangerous about conduit debt financing. Similarly, it's not new either. Municipalities and companies alike have used such structures since the 1980s.

But, with the massive speculation around AI investments, such an arrangement could lead to problems. For example, what if the tech company decides to stop leasing the data center? In <a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Announces-Joint-Venture-with-Funds-Managed-by-Blue-Owl-Capital-to-Develop-Hyperion-Data-Center/default.aspx">Meta's recent $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital</a>, they have the option to cancel the lease after only four years (but will need to pay a capped termination fee to do so).

Technically, the SPV could just lease the data center to another tech company. But what if the specialized infrastructure or the chips inside the data center have become obsolete? What happens if the demand for compute falls dramatically? What will the SPV investors do then? The equity holders will obviously get wiped out, but who will pay back the debt holders?

If the SPV debt holders were all hedge funds, this wouldn't be a problem. But they're not. Since the SPV will typically have a credit rating <em>just below</em> that of the tech company, institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies are eligible to become debt holders. And, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/democratizing-access-to-alternative-assets-for-401k-investors/">if some politicians had their way</a>, retail investors <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-one-thing-my-worst-investments-had-in-common/">would be eligible as well</a>.

Unfortunately, when these kind of investors lose lots of money, things can get really bad. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-america-insurance-part-2/?utm_campaign=2025011_BATC_winb_eng_markets_bigtake_winb_eng_markets_bigtake_2025&amp;utm_term=20549703&amp;utm_source=subs-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=15791414">Bloomberg recently reported</a>, PHL Variable Insurance Co., a private-equity backed insurance company, couldn't make payments to policyholders due to a $2.2 billion shortfall. What happens when other insurance companies can't make payments to policyholders because their SPV debt defaults?

It's hard to imagine such an outcome when GPUs/TPUs are the most sought after product on Earth. However, just because a technology is becoming popular doesn't mean it will outperform in financial markets. As Jeffrey Gundlach explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7JV_DaBFXk&amp;t=1547s">in a recent episode of Odd Lots</a>:
<blockquote>Probably the biggest thing that changed the economy, and the world, in the last, I don't know, 150 years was electricity. Electricity being put into peoples' homes was probably one of the biggest changes of all time.

And, of course, around 1900 people realized that electricity to homes was coming. And so electricity stocks were in a huge mania and they did incredibly well. But the relative performance of electricity, relative to...everything else but electricity...peaked in 1911. Houses weren't even broadly electrified by 1911.</blockquote>
Gundlach is exactly right. <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-birth-of-the-grid">Only about 16% of U.S. homes had electricity</a> in 1911, yet <em>that</em> was when the relative performance peaked for electricity stocks.

More importantly, a technology bubble can burst even though the underlying infrastructure is still incredibly valuable. Ben Eidelson and Anay Shah noted this in the Stepchange podcast <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Lh6C83syrkKKLCxIfqUKw?si=c005232a42fe4bbf">when discussing the collapse of the DotCom bubble</a>:
<blockquote>And by 2001 everything collapsed. Advertising folded. Startups folded…PSI Net, one of the largest ISPs, had already collapsed.

And so was this the death of the internet and the death of value all this fiber that was laid? Clearly not.

It was the death of a particular moment and the overbuild in a bubble. But, in fact, the actual infrastructure that was built out would prove immensely valuable as services that mattered matured and business models matured.</blockquote>
These examples demonstrate that the demand for a technology can remain high even if the economics don't make sense for a period of time.

Today, it seems like there is no feasible scenario where demand for data center compute could be lower. But this is how every bubble bursts. One big assumption turns out to be false.
<h2 class="quoteText">When What You Know For Sure Just Ain't So</h2>
The big assumption in the GFC was that housing prices couldn't fall across the nation <em>at the same time</em>. This is important because MBS were generally geographically diversified and the homes themselves acted as collateral in the event borrowers didn't pay their mortgages. So, it was assumed that if home prices dropped in California, home prices in Texas wouldn't be impacted (and vice versa). When this assumption turned out to be false, things started to come undone.

Similarly, the big assumption today is that the demand for compute cannot go down.&nbsp; If that turns out to be false (somehow), then a lot of high-flying AI stocks will fall back to Earth.

Of course, I have no idea how this will play out. The number of events that could derail this theory are enormous. More importantly, conduit debt financing is still small and doesn't currently represent an existential threat to the financial system. But, with the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-10-02/ai-data-centers-give-private-credit-its-mojo-back">trillions of dollars that tech companies plan to spend on data centers in the next few years</a>, small can become "too big to fail" in a hurry.

I'm not an expert in conduit debt financing, but when something seems off, I take note. And how tech companies plan to use SPVs over the next few years seems like one of those things that will be viewed as obviously problematic in hindsight. Because if these big tech companies aren't taking the risk, <em>someone else is</em>.

Is it Wall Street? Is it Main Street? Will it be the Fed when they have to buy up "distressed" data centers?

I know this might seem a bit far-fetched now, but the CFO of OpenAI has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/openai-cfo-would-support-federal-backstop-for-chip-investments/4F6C864C-7332-448B-A9B4-66C321E60FE7">already discussed the possibility of a government backstop</a>&nbsp;to chip investments, though <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarah-friar_openai-wants-federal-backstop-for-new-investments-activity-7392049356012507136-wAV7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAh3NYgBKS9uoyYd35mcdyiDSjdH6BmlJTc">she later retracted it</a>.

I may come off as a bit alarmist in this post. But if a bunch of SPVs default in the future, don't say you weren't warned.

		<title>The One Thing My Worst Investments Had in Common</title>

					<description><![CDATA[The worst investments I've ever owned all share one thing in common—I couldn't sell them.&nbsp;Whether we are talking fractional shares of expensive artwork or <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-not-to-invest/">private investments in friends' companies</a>, I didn't realize the paramount importance of liquidity until quite recently.

And I'm saying this as the <a href="https://amzn.to/4qIeLb8"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a> guy. Trust me, I don't sell investments often. But, sometimes, I have to. Sometimes it's for a rebalance. Sometimes it's to generate a tax loss. Either way, I need to sell.

But, what if I can't sell them? What if there's no secondary market for these assets? What's the point of owning 9 square inches of a Basquiat if no one ever buys it? What's the point of having private shares in a company if they keep doing <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downround.asp">down rounds</a>?

Illiquidity can be brutal.&nbsp;I didn't understand this as a younger investor. I assumed that having more asset classes was <em>always</em> better. Have a little bit of everything because diversification, right?

But now I'm paying the price for that decision. Owning un-diversified, illiquid assets is one of the worst things I've done as an investor.&nbsp;It's worse than just losing money because when you lose money <em>you know the end result</em>. The uncertainty is gone. But owning illiquid assets, especially those that aren't doing well, is investment purgatory.

I have private company shares that are worth more to me <em>as a tax loss</em> than their current value on my balance sheet. Of course, I don't want these companies to fail. But locking up my money for a decade and watching them fail anyways would be the worst of both worlds. Though I'd still get my tax loss, I'd only get it <em>after</em> it's been devalued by inflation for a decade. This is why I now despise illiquidity in my portfolio.

But not everyone agrees. Some see illiquidity as a feature, not a bug of a great investment. This seems to be the case when it comes to private equity and venture capital investments. As <a href="https://x.com/MeghanKReynolds/status/1930785042290385138">Silicon Valley Bank's State of the Markets</a> highlighted, top quartile funds typically don't return capital for over 15 years:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/svb_state_of_markets_top_quartile.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30711" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/svb_state_of_markets_top_quartile.png" alt="" width="700" height="284"></a>

This illustrates just how long it can take for these kinds of investments to play out. And, unless you've accepted this going in, then you shouldn't even bother.

I didn't realize this when I made all of my illiquid investments in 2021. Then again, if some of these investments had done well, today I'd probably be singing a very different tune. Unfortunately, they haven't.

But it's not just me who's struggling with illiquidity. Dan Rasmussen <a href="https://youtu.be/xfWWgdORvZM?si=cOIpleogsD2r6BPz&amp;t=2301">recently gave an interview</a> where he discussed the liquidity issues he's seeing across private equity:
<blockquote>I think we're in phase one where private equity can't sell the assets that they have. So people are saying "Oh gosh, they can't get distributions." But they still think it's worth exactly what the private equity firms are telling them.</blockquote>
The only logical conclusion from Rasmussen's analysis is that prices must fall.

Unfortunately, private equity doesn't have a great track record when it comes to marking their investments to market. Just consider the case of Blackstone's Real Estate Investment Trust (BREIT) from September 2021 to September 2023:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/econompic_breit_vs_others_2021_2023.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26056" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/econompic_breit_vs_others_2021_2023.jpeg" alt="BREIT vs all publicly traded real estate funds" width="700" height="452"></a>

One of these things is not like the others.&nbsp;

So, how does private equity get out of this jam? They have two options:
<ol>
 	<li>Gradually re-price their investments to fair market value.</li>
 	<li>Sell to unsuspecting investors at current prices.</li>
</ol>
Guess which one they're going to go with?

You guessed it—sell to unsuspecting investors at current prices. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag14Ao_xO4c">the Margin Call scene</a>:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fair_market_price.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30741" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fair_market_price.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="383"></a>

Why do you think the White House put out <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/democratizing-access-to-alternative-assets-for-401k-investors/">an executive order a few months ago</a> to "democratize access" to alternative assets in 401(k) plans? Did Donald Trump wake up one day suddenly offended that grandma and grandpa couldn't buy private equity like all of his rich buddies?

Please. I've never seen a more blatant use of "democratization" as a disguise for selling someone else's bags. Private equity needs exit liquidity and everyday Americans have it.

Does this mean that every person who buys private equity in their 401(k) is going to lose money? Not necessarily. I can't predict how this will play out. However, anytime an exclusive club opens its doors to the general public, <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-death-of-the-amex-lounge/">it usually doesn't end well</a>.

I'm all for democratizing access when people are well-informed and know what they are getting themselves into. Unfortunately, I don't feel like that's the spirit of this current push for alternatives.

Why now? Why wasn't Trump or anyone else advocating for main street to own alternatives a decade ago? I think we all know the answer.&nbsp;

In general, I'm <a href="https://x.com/dollarsanddata/status/1881178166376661280">not one to regulate what people invest in</a>. I think most investors are smart enough to make their own decisions. They don't need to be protected. This is definitely true when it comes to memecoins and crypto. By this point, <a href="https://x.com/dollarsanddata/status/1893009319064482236">people know what they are getting themselves into</a>.&nbsp;

But retirement accounts <em>feel</em> different. These are meant for a specific purpose at a specific point in time far in the future. While owning private equity is not like owning a memecoin, I'm not so sure people will fully understand what these investments entail. They may not understand the lack of liquidity or the higher fees.

How do I know? Because I didn't fully understand them when I made my private investments in 2021, just four years ago. And I'm someone who knows quite a bit about this stuff. If you had asked me in 2021 whether these private investments were illiquid, I would've told you "Yes." I knew what illiquid meant <em>from a theoretical perspective</em>.

But I had never lived with illiquidity. I had never experienced it firsthand. That's the lesson I learned the hard way. That's what all of my most difficult investments have in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of course, this advice may only apply to me. Despite being a long-term investor, I can be quite impatient sometimes. But it's better to be honest with yourself than to make the same mistake again in the future.&nbsp;

Happy investing and thank you for reading!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The worst investments I've ever owned all share one thing in common—I couldn't sell them.&nbsp;Whether we are talking fractional shares of expensive artwork or <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-not-to-invest/">private investments in friends' companies</a>, I didn't realize the paramount importance of liquidity until quite recently.

And I'm saying this as the <a href="https://amzn.to/4qIeLb8"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a> guy. Trust me, I don't sell investments often. But, sometimes, I have to. Sometimes it's for a rebalance. Sometimes it's to generate a tax loss. Either way, I need to sell.

But, what if I can't sell them? What if there's no secondary market for these assets? What's the point of owning 9 square inches of a Basquiat if no one ever buys it? What's the point of having private shares in a company if they keep doing <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downround.asp">down rounds</a>?

Illiquidity can be brutal.&nbsp;I didn't understand this as a younger investor. I assumed that having more asset classes was <em>always</em> better. Have a little bit of everything because diversification, right?

But now I'm paying the price for that decision. Owning un-diversified, illiquid assets is one of the worst things I've done as an investor.&nbsp;It's worse than just losing money because when you lose money <em>you know the end result</em>. The uncertainty is gone. But owning illiquid assets, especially those that aren't doing well, is investment purgatory.

I have private company shares that are worth more to me <em>as a tax loss</em> than their current value on my balance sheet. Of course, I don't want these companies to fail. But locking up my money for a decade and watching them fail anyways would be the worst of both worlds. Though I'd still get my tax loss, I'd only get it <em>after</em> it's been devalued by inflation for a decade. This is why I now despise illiquidity in my portfolio.

But not everyone agrees. Some see illiquidity as a feature, not a bug of a great investment. This seems to be the case when it comes to private equity and venture capital investments. As <a href="https://x.com/MeghanKReynolds/status/1930785042290385138">Silicon Valley Bank's State of the Markets</a> highlighted, top quartile funds typically don't return capital for over 15 years:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/svb_state_of_markets_top_quartile.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30711" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/svb_state_of_markets_top_quartile.png" alt="" width="700" height="284"></a>

This illustrates just how long it can take for these kinds of investments to play out. And, unless you've accepted this going in, then you shouldn't even bother.

I didn't realize this when I made all of my illiquid investments in 2021. Then again, if some of these investments had done well, today I'd probably be singing a very different tune. Unfortunately, they haven't.

But it's not just me who's struggling with illiquidity. Dan Rasmussen <a href="https://youtu.be/xfWWgdORvZM?si=cOIpleogsD2r6BPz&amp;t=2301">recently gave an interview</a> where he discussed the liquidity issues he's seeing across private equity:
<blockquote>I think we're in phase one where private equity can't sell the assets that they have. So people are saying "Oh gosh, they can't get distributions." But they still think it's worth exactly what the private equity firms are telling them.</blockquote>
The only logical conclusion from Rasmussen's analysis is that prices must fall.

Unfortunately, private equity doesn't have a great track record when it comes to marking their investments to market. Just consider the case of Blackstone's Real Estate Investment Trust (BREIT) from September 2021 to September 2023:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/econompic_breit_vs_others_2021_2023.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26056" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/econompic_breit_vs_others_2021_2023.jpeg" alt="BREIT vs all publicly traded real estate funds" width="700" height="452"></a>

One of these things is not like the others.&nbsp;

So, how does private equity get out of this jam? They have two options:
<ol>
 	<li>Gradually re-price their investments to fair market value.</li>
 	<li>Sell to unsuspecting investors at current prices.</li>
</ol>
Guess which one they're going to go with?

You guessed it—sell to unsuspecting investors at current prices. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag14Ao_xO4c">the Margin Call scene</a>:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fair_market_price.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30741" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fair_market_price.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="383"></a>

Why do you think the White House put out <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/democratizing-access-to-alternative-assets-for-401k-investors/">an executive order a few months ago</a> to "democratize access" to alternative assets in 401(k) plans? Did Donald Trump wake up one day suddenly offended that grandma and grandpa couldn't buy private equity like all of his rich buddies?

Please. I've never seen a more blatant use of "democratization" as a disguise for selling someone else's bags. Private equity needs exit liquidity and everyday Americans have it.

Does this mean that every person who buys private equity in their 401(k) is going to lose money? Not necessarily. I can't predict how this will play out. However, anytime an exclusive club opens its doors to the general public, <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-death-of-the-amex-lounge/">it usually doesn't end well</a>.

I'm all for democratizing access when people are well-informed and know what they are getting themselves into. Unfortunately, I don't feel like that's the spirit of this current push for alternatives.

Why now? Why wasn't Trump or anyone else advocating for main street to own alternatives a decade ago? I think we all know the answer.&nbsp;

In general, I'm <a href="https://x.com/dollarsanddata/status/1881178166376661280">not one to regulate what people invest in</a>. I think most investors are smart enough to make their own decisions. They don't need to be protected. This is definitely true when it comes to memecoins and crypto. By this point, <a href="https://x.com/dollarsanddata/status/1893009319064482236">people know what they are getting themselves into</a>.&nbsp;

But retirement accounts <em>feel</em> different. These are meant for a specific purpose at a specific point in time far in the future. While owning private equity is not like owning a memecoin, I'm not so sure people will fully understand what these investments entail. They may not understand the lack of liquidity or the higher fees.

How do I know? Because I didn't fully understand them when I made my private investments in 2021, just four years ago. And I'm someone who knows quite a bit about this stuff. If you had asked me in 2021 whether these private investments were illiquid, I would've told you "Yes." I knew what illiquid meant <em>from a theoretical perspective</em>.

But I had never lived with illiquidity. I had never experienced it firsthand. That's the lesson I learned the hard way. That's what all of my most difficult investments have in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of course, this advice may only apply to me. Despite being a long-term investor, I can be quite impatient sometimes. But it's better to be honest with yourself than to make the same mistake again in the future.&nbsp;

Happy investing and thank you for reading!

					<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I published </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3Jkue0q"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wealth Ladder</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three and a half months ago, I’ve had a few readers reach out and ask, “Is there an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ideal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> level of wealth?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My gut reaction is to say, “Yes, the ideal level of wealth is the amount of money that allows you to live on your own terms.” In </span><a href="https://amzn.to/4o7YbQA"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art of Spending Money</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Morgan Housel defines the highest level of wealth as:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">You wake up every morning realizing that you can spend your time doing what you want, with whom you want, for as long as you want.</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These answers are both technically correct. The ideal level of wealth </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dependent on your personal circumstances. It’s based on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what you want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of life.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the more I think about these responses, the more I find them unsatisfying. If the ideal level of wealth is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on individual circumstances, then we can’t provide any <em>general</em> guidelines around it. If everyone is special, then no one is. In effect, we’ve maximized precision but minimized usefulness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what if we reversed this? What if instead of giving the perfect answer for everyone, we found a pretty good answer for most people? What if we gave up some specificity to have more practicality? What would the ideal level of wealth look like then?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can define it, even approximately, then we’ll have a better idea of when to keep pursuing money and when to stop. And, once we know this, we can get to our ideal level of wealth and then start living the good life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, how much does “the good life” actually cost?</span>
<h2><b>How Much Do You Need to Live a Good Life?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the answer to this question will vary based on your circumstances, let’s assume that you, your spouse, and your two children live in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">median</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> priced home in the United States. This won't cover everyone, but it's a good base case that we can adjust from.</span>

<strong>Using this as a base case, a family of four spends roughly $120,000 per year <em>after</em> taxes to maintain a middle-class lifestyle.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's how that breaks down by category, based on data (mostly) from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">Consumer Expenditure Survey</a> (Bureau of Labor Statistics) and a few other sources:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Housing: $35,000</strong> ($2,917 per month). <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">As of Q2 2025</a>, the median sale price for homes in the U.S. was $410,800. Putting 20% down, that would leave a mortgage of $328,640. At 6.2% for a 30-year fixed rate loan (the current rate), that's about $2,013 per month. Add in property tax at 1% per year (of the property value), maintenance at 1% per year, and insurance at 0.5% per year, and that's another $854 per month (or $10,270 per year). Putting it all together and adding a little wiggle room, a family of four would pay around $2,917 per month, or $35,000 per year, for housing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Transportation: $20,000</strong> ($1,667 per month). Using <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">the Consumer Expenditure ("CE") data</a>, a couple with two children spent approximately $18,463 on transportation in 2023. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Adjusting for inflation</a> to September 2025, that comes out to around $20,000 per year today.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Food: $17,000</strong> ($1,417 per month). <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">Once again from the CE data</a>, spending on food for a married couple with two children was $15,558 in 2023. If we adjust for inflation that comes out to $16,890, so I rounded up to $17,000 for good measure.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Childcare: $15,000</strong> ($1,250 per month). These costs will vary significantly over time, but the average annual cost of full-time care was around $11,582 per child in 2023, <a href="https://www.childcareaware.org/thechildcarestandstill/">according to Child Care Aware of America</a>. Assuming our hypothetical couple has one younger child (in childcare/daycare) and one slightly older child in after school programs (that may cost around $3,000 per year), then the total annual cost is close to $15,000. Of course, this will vary wildly depending on the type of childcare programs you enroll your children in.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Apparel and Entertainment: $12,000 </strong>($1,000 per month). Using <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">the CE estimates</a>, annual costs for apparel and entertainment for a family of four in 2023 were $3,500 and $6,500, respectively. Add in some inflation and a little wiggle room and you're at $12,000 per year.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Healthcare: $8,500</strong> ($708 per month). In the U.S., healthcare is mostly covered through employer-sponsored plans, but the cost of copays and other costs <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">were around $7,700 in 2023</a>. Add in some basic inflation and you get $8,500.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Utilities: $6,600 </strong>($550 per month). The CE data states that <span style="font-weight: 400;">a couple with two children spent $6,102 on utilities in 2023. Adjusting for inflation (to get to September 2025) and that comes out to $6,600 per year.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Travel: $6,000</strong> ($500 per month). A <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/travel/learn/disney-family-vacation-cost">NerdWallet study found</a> that the average cost for a family of four trip to Disney World for seven nights is around $6,000. Of course, there are cheaper and definitely more expensive ways to vacation annually, but I'm leaving this $6,000 expense as is for now.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
Note that the $120,000 is pure consumption and doesn't account for saving for retirement. This was intentional. We care about living expenses and retirement savings aren't a living expense, but an expected <em>future&nbsp;</em>living expense.

This aside, y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou can easily adjust this annual amount based on your own consumption habits. For example, my total spending in the above scenario would probably be closer to $170,000 per year after taxes (or $50,000 more) because my housing and food costs are closer to double these amounts.</span>

For the time being though, let's stick with our $120,000 annual spending amount. <span style="font-weight: 400;">How much wealth is needed to support this much spending? Let's start at the high-end and then work downward from there.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Financial Independence (28.6x Your Annual Spending): $3.5M</strong>. Assuming you never wanted to work again, you would need about 28.6x your annual spending to cover your costs indefinitely [$120,000 * 28.6 ~ $3,500,000]. This 28.6 comes from <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/adjusting-safe-withdrawal-rates-to-the-retirees-time-horizon/">the Kitces research</a> showing that the 3.5% Rule is the <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/">safe withdrawal rate</a> for a 40-year time horizon <em>and beyond</em>. This research suggests that if you can make it 40 years while withdrawing 3.5% per year, then you'll likely make it 50 years (or more).&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Multiplying our annual spending by 28.6 (to get the required amount) is mathematically equivalent to dividing our annual spending by 3.5%. So, $120,000 divided by 0.035 is the same as $120,000 multiplied by 28.6 (to get to $3.5M).&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Lastly, this assumes that your income is derived from liquid assets and is <em>after</em> taxes. This is unlikely to be the case for most people. To adjust for this, multiply the total amount needed by 1.25 (+25%) to act as a tax buffer. So, $3.5M would be closer to $4.5M if a good chunk of this money was in qualified accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Coast FIRE (Varies by Age): $1M-$2M</b>. Instead of never working again, with <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/coast-fire/">Coast FIRE</a> you save up a certain amount for retirement, then stop saving money after that. However, <em>you will need to continue working</em> to support yourself until you reach your retirement. Coast FIRE is easier to reach than financial independence because you don't need to save as much to secure your financial future.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For example, if you need $3.5M in assets by the time you're 65, then we can back out how much you'd need today to get there. Below are these amounts by age (assuming a 3.5% annual real return on your money thereafter):
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Age 30 = $1,049,919</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Age 40 = $1,481,014</li>
 	<li>Age 50 = $2,089,117</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
You can see this visually in the chart below (for ages 20-65):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coast_fire_3p5_million_final.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-30591 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coast_fire_3p5_million_final.jpeg" alt="Coast FIRE amounts by age for $3.5M at age 65." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, the amount of wealth needed to live a "good life" is much lower when we continue working (versus never having to work again). Of course, Coast FIRE is riskier than financial independence since you still need to earn an income to support your lifestyle indefinitely. However, Coast FIRE also provides more flexibility and is more realistic for the typical person. Most people don't want to sit around doing nothing all day. Don't get me wrong, it's fun and relaxing for a week or two, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/if-you-play-with-fire-dont-get-burned/">I've written about the problems it can lead to</a>.

<strong>Whether your goal is Coast FIRE or full financial independence, the ideal level of wealth in the U.S. is in the low-to-mid range of <a href="https://amzn.to/49pSSHo">Level 4 ($1M-$10M)</a>, or $2M-$5M. </strong>I know this is a lot of money and many people will never reach it, but that's why it's an ideal. It's something to strive for. It's enough where you don't have to worry about money anymore, but not so much that it becomes a burden or warps your identity.

And, yes, it can warp your identity. Great wealth can influence who you trust, what motivates you, your stress levels, and even how you raise your children. As Felix Dennis wrote in <a href="https://amzn.to/47EvDYV"><em>How to Get Rich</em></a>:
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Still, let me repeat it one more time. Becoming rich does not guarantee happiness. In fact, it is almost certain to impose the opposite condition—if not from the stresses and strains of protecting wealth, then from the guilt that inevitably accompanies its arrival.</p>
</blockquote>
This is coming from a man who was worth $750M at the time.

This is a "problem" few of us will ever have. Most of us face the opposite one—not having enough. But if Level 4 seems out of the question for you, don't worry. Because there's another path to the good life that's quite a bit cheaper.
<h2><b>A Cheaper Path to the Good Life</b></h2>
So far, when discussing the "ideal" level of wealth, I've assumed that you live in a medium-cost-of-living area in the U.S. However, if you were to move to a cheaper area in the U.S. or <em>outside</em> of the U.S., your ideal level of wealth would be much lower.&nbsp;

For example, many countries in Europe have free (or low-cost) education, healthcare, and other social services. Yes, their citizens often pay more tax for these services, but this arrangement effectively lowers the bar for the ideal level of wealth. Ultimately, you need less when your society provides more.

<strong>Because of this, I truly believe you can live a very fulfilling life in Level 3 ($100k-$1M) of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Jkue0q">The Wealth Ladder</a>,</em> whether in a cheaper part of the U.S. or abroad.</strong> Is it possible to have a fulfilling life in Level 2 ($10k-$100k) or Level 1 (&lt;$10k) of The Wealth Ladder? Technically yes. Personal fulfillment is not restricted to how much money you have.

However, most people would not call Level 1–2 the <em>ideal</em> level of wealth for a host of reasons. Fewer financial resources mean more risk. More risk that you can't afford necessary healthcare. More risk that you can't support yourself or your family. More risk that you don't live up to your potential. And so forth.

We shouldn't be obsessed with money, but we can't deny its importance either. It impacts where we live, what we eat, who we date, what we enjoy, who we befriend, what we work on, and much more.&nbsp;

While the ideal level of wealth allows you to live life on your own terms, don't forget that those terms are never free.

This won't cover everyone, but it's a good base case that we can adjust from.</span>

<strong>Using this as a base case, a family of four spends roughly $120,000 per year <em>after</em> taxes to maintain a middle-class lifestyle.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's how that breaks down by category, based on data (mostly) from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">Consumer Expenditure Survey</a> (Bureau of Labor Statistics) and a few other sources:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Housing: $35,000</strong> ($2,917 per month). <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">As of Q2 2025</a>, the median sale price for homes in the U.S. was $410,800. Putting 20% down, that would leave a mortgage of $328,640. At 6.2% for a 30-year fixed rate loan (the current rate), that's about $2,013 per month. Add in property tax at 1% per year (of the property value), maintenance at 1% per year, and insurance at 0.5% per year, and that's another $854 per month (or $10,270 per year). Putting it all together and adding a little wiggle room, a family of four would pay around $2,917 per month, or $35,000 per year, for housing.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Transportation: $20,000</strong> ($1,667 per month). Using <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">the Consumer Expenditure ("CE") data</a>, a couple with two children spent approximately $18,463 on transportation in 2023. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Adjusting for inflation</a> to September 2025, that comes out to around $20,000 per year today.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Food: $17,000</strong> ($1,417 per month). <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">Once again from the CE data</a>, spending on food for a married couple with two children was $15,558 in 2023. If we adjust for inflation that comes out to $16,890, so I rounded up to $17,000 for good measure.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Childcare: $15,000</strong> ($1,250 per month). These costs will vary significantly over time, but the average annual cost of full-time care was around $11,582 per child in 2023, <a href="https://www.childcareaware.org/thechildcarestandstill/">according to Child Care Aware of America</a>. Assuming our hypothetical couple has one younger child (in childcare/daycare) and one slightly older child in after school programs (that may cost around $3,000 per year), then the total annual cost is close to $15,000. Of course, this will vary wildly depending on the type of childcare programs you enroll your children in.</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Apparel and Entertainment: $12,000 </strong>($1,000 per month). Using <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">the CE estimates</a>, annual costs for apparel and entertainment for a family of four in 2023 were $3,500 and $6,500, respectively. Add in some inflation and a little wiggle room and you're at $12,000 per year.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Healthcare: $8,500</strong> ($708 per month). In the U.S., healthcare is mostly covered through employer-sponsored plans, but the cost of copays and other costs <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=479&amp;eid=1200030">were around $7,700 in 2023</a>. Add in some basic inflation and you get $8,500.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Utilities: $6,600 </strong>($550 per month). The CE data states that <span style="font-weight: 400;">a couple with two children spent $6,102 on utilities in 2023. Adjusting for inflation (to get to September 2025) and that comes out to $6,600 per year.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Travel: $6,000</strong> ($500 per month). A <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/travel/learn/disney-family-vacation-cost">NerdWallet study found</a> that the average cost for a family of four trip to Disney World for seven nights is around $6,000. Of course, there are cheaper and definitely more expensive ways to vacation annually, but I'm leaving this $6,000 expense as is for now.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
Note that the $120,000 is pure consumption and doesn't account for saving for retirement. This was intentional. We care about living expenses and retirement savings aren't a living expense, but an expected <em>future&nbsp;</em>living expense.

This aside, y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou can easily adjust this annual amount based on your own consumption habits. For example, my total spending in the above scenario would probably be closer to $170,000 per year after taxes (or $50,000 more) because my housing and food costs are closer to double these amounts.</span>

For the time being though, let's stick with our $120,000 annual spending amount. <span style="font-weight: 400;">How much wealth is needed to support this much spending? Let's start at the high-end and then work downward from there.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Financial Independence (28.6x Your Annual Spending): $3.5M</strong>. Assuming you never wanted to work again, you would need about 28.6x your annual spending to cover your costs indefinitely [$120,000 * 28.6 ~ $3,500,000]. This 28.6 comes from <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/adjusting-safe-withdrawal-rates-to-the-retirees-time-horizon/">the Kitces research</a> showing that the 3.5% Rule is the <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/safe-withdrawal-rate/">safe withdrawal rate</a> for a 40-year time horizon <em>and beyond</em>. This research suggests that if you can make it 40 years while withdrawing 3.5% per year, then you'll likely make it 50 years (or more).&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Multiplying our annual spending by 28.6 (to get the required amount) is mathematically equivalent to dividing our annual spending by 3.5%. So, $120,000 divided by 0.035 is the same as $120,000 multiplied by 28.6 (to get to $3.5M).&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Lastly, this assumes that your income is derived from liquid assets and is <em>after</em> taxes. This is unlikely to be the case for most people. To adjust for this, multiply the total amount needed by 1.25 (+25%) to act as a tax buffer. So, $3.5M would be closer to $4.5M if a good chunk of this money was in qualified accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Coast FIRE (Varies by Age): $1M-$2M</b>. Instead of never working again, with <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/coast-fire/">Coast FIRE</a> you save up a certain amount for retirement, then stop saving money after that. However, <em>you will need to continue working</em> to support yourself until you reach your retirement. Coast FIRE is easier to reach than financial independence because you don't need to save as much to secure your financial future.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">For example, if you need $3.5M in assets by the time you're 65, then we can back out how much you'd need today to get there. Below are these amounts by age (assuming a 3.5% annual real return on your money thereafter):
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Age 30 = $1,049,919</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Age 40 = $1,481,014</li>
 	<li>Age 50 = $2,089,117</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
You can see this visually in the chart below (for ages 20-65):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coast_fire_3p5_million_final.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-30591 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coast_fire_3p5_million_final.jpeg" alt="Coast FIRE amounts by age for $3.5M at age 65." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, the amount of wealth needed to live a "good life" is much lower when we continue working (versus never having to work again). Of course, Coast FIRE is riskier than financial independence since you still need to earn an income to support your lifestyle indefinitely. However, Coast FIRE also provides more flexibility and is more realistic for the typical person. Most people don't want to sit around doing nothing all day. Don't get me wrong, it's fun and relaxing for a week or two, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/if-you-play-with-fire-dont-get-burned/">I've written about the problems it can lead to</a>.

<strong>Whether your goal is Coast FIRE or full financial independence, the ideal level of wealth in the U.S. is in the low-to-mid range of <a href="https://amzn.to/49pSSHo">Level 4 ($1M-$10M)</a>, or $2M-$5M. </strong>I know this is a lot of money and many people will never reach it, but that's why it's an ideal. It's something to strive for. It's enough where you don't have to worry about money anymore, but not so much that it becomes a burden or warps your identity.

And, yes, it can warp your identity. Great wealth can influence who you trust, what motivates you, your stress levels, and even how you raise your children. As Felix Dennis wrote in <a href="https://amzn.to/47EvDYV"><em>How to Get Rich</em></a>:
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Still, let me repeat it one more time. Becoming rich does not guarantee happiness. In fact, it is almost certain to impose the opposite condition—if not from the stresses and strains of protecting wealth, then from the guilt that inevitably accompanies its arrival.</p>
</blockquote>
This is coming from a man who was worth $750M at the time.

This is a "problem" few of us will ever have. Most of us face the opposite one—not having enough. But if Level 4 seems out of the question for you, don't worry. Because there's another path to the good life that's quite a bit cheaper.
<h2><b>A Cheaper Path to the Good Life</b></h2>
So far, when discussing the "ideal" level of wealth, I've assumed that you live in a medium-cost-of-living area in the U.S. However, if you were to move to a cheaper area in the U.S. or <em>outside</em> of the U.S., your ideal level of wealth would be much lower.&nbsp;

For example, many countries in Europe have free (or low-cost) education, healthcare, and other social services. Yes, their citizens often pay more tax for these services, but this arrangement effectively lowers the bar for the ideal level of wealth. Ultimately, you need less when your society provides more.

<strong>Because of this, I truly believe you can live a very fulfilling life in Level 3 ($100k-$1M) of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Jkue0q">The Wealth Ladder</a>,</em> whether in a cheaper part of the U.S. or abroad.</strong> Is it possible to have a fulfilling life in Level 2 ($10k-$100k) or Level 1 (&lt;$10k) of The Wealth Ladder? Technically yes. Personal fulfillment is not restricted to how much money you have.

However, most people would not call Level 1–2 the <em>ideal</em> level of wealth for a host of reasons. Fewer financial resources mean more risk. More risk that you can't afford necessary healthcare. More risk that you can't support yourself or your family. More risk that you don't live up to your potential. And so forth.

We shouldn't be obsessed with money, but we can't deny its importance either. It impacts where we live, what we eat, who we date, what we enjoy, who we befriend, what we work on, and much more.&nbsp;

While the ideal level of wealth allows you to live life on your own terms, don't forget that those terms are never free.

					<description><![CDATA[With the S&amp;P 500 hitting its 36th all-time high of 2025 last week, many investors are wondering whether now is a good time to buy. After all, wouldn't you get a better price if you waited? Technically, you very likely would. As I stated in <a href="https://amzn.to/47rb2WO"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a>:
<blockquote>If you randomly picked a trading day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1930-2020, there is over a 95% chance that the Dow would close <em>lower</em> on <em>some</em> day in the future.</blockquote>
So while we are <em>likely</em> to see a lower price by waiting, unfortunately, these lower prices are rare (i.e. they only occur on 5% of days). More importantly, these 5% of days can't be identified ahead of time.

But, what about after an all-time high? The analysis above was done across <em>all</em> trading days. If we subset to only all-time highs, would the probability of seeing a lower price in the future change?&nbsp;

To test this, I re-ran this analysis from January 1915 to October 2025 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Across <em>all </em>trading days, the chance that the Dow would close lower on <em>some day</em> in the future was 96.7% (even higher than during 1930-2020 period).

But, if you bought at an all-time high, the probability that you'd see a lower price in the future was 97.0%. It was <em>slightly</em> <em>higher</em> than when the market is not at an all-time high.

While this might seem like evidence that you shouldn't buy at all-time highs, unfortunately, this difference was <em>not</em> statistically significant. The difference between 96.7% and 97.0% seems to be just random chance. <strong>In other words, when you buy at an all-time high you are <em>no more likely</em> to see a future lower price than buying on any other trading day.</strong>

So while buying U.S. stocks at an all-time high doesn't seem to harm us, does it help us?

Historically, not really.

From 1950-2025, the future 1-year returns of the S&amp;P 500 are actually lower when near an all-time high ("Near ATH") than when off an all-time high ("Off ATH") [8.3% vs. 10.1%]. In this case "Near ATH" means anytime the S&amp;P 500 is within 5% of an all-time high, "Off ATH" is all other times:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30664" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the S&amp;P 500)" width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, the 1-year return distributions are similar though the "Off ATH" distribution is shifted slightly to the right (i.e. has better returns).

But if we look over a 3-year return window, this changes. For 3-year future returns, it's better to be near an all-time high than off of one [8.4% annualized vs. 7.8% annualized]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30665" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next 3 years by all-time high status (for the S&amp;P 500)" width="700" height="560"></a>

Because the 1-year and 3-year returns point in opposite directions, this suggests that market timing based on all-time highs doesn't work. In other words, <strong>being near an all-time high doesn't seem to impact future U.S. stock returns in any consistent or meaningful way.</strong>

While there are long stretches where the S&amp;P 500 doesn't hit all-time highs (see below), these periods have been quite rare:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_SPX_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30667" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_SPX_2025.jpeg" alt="Days Between All-Time Highs for the S&amp;P 500 from 1950-2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

But what about other markets? Though the S&amp;P 500 doesn't seem to have any difference in returns when near all-time highs, what about non-U.S. equities? Let's turn to those now.
<h2>What About International Stocks at All-Time Highs?</h2>
When it comes to international stocks, I looked at how the <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/822e3d18-16fb-4d23-9295-11bc9e07b8ba" rel="noopener">MSCI EAFE</a> ("Developed stocks") and <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c0db0a48-01f2-4ba9-ad01-226fd5678111" rel="noopener">MSCI Emerging Markets</a> ("EM stocks") indices performed going back to 1970 and 1989, respectively. Overall the EAFE (Developed stocks) tend to do slightly better when <em>near</em> an all-time high over the next year [9.0% vs 7.2% on average]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30677" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the MSCI EAFE)" width="700" height="560"></a>However, these stocks tend to do slightly <em>worse</em> when near an all-time high over the next three years [5% annualized vs. 6.7% annualized]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30678" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next three years by all-time high status (for the MSCI EAFE)" width="700" height="560"></a>

This suggests that any momentum for EAFE stocks tends to be short-lived.

<strong>However, this is <em>not&nbsp;</em>the case for Emerging Market stocks, which do about 2x better over both 1-year and 3-year periods when near all-time highs.&nbsp;</strong>Over the next year, EM stocks return 15.6% (on average) when near an all-time high versus only 7.9% when off of one:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30679" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the MSCI Emerging Markets)" width="700" height="560"></a>

And over the next three years, EM stocks return 10.5% (annualized) when near an all-time high versus only 5.1% (annualized) when off of one:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30680" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next three years by all-time high status (for the MSCI Emerging Markets)" width="700" height="560"></a>

This suggests that momentum plays a bigger role with EM stocks than with U.S. or Developed stocks.

We can see this in the chart below which shows the MSCI Emerging Markets index over time with all-time highs plotted in red. Note how EM stocks seem to have bursts of high returns followed by extended periods of stagnation:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/price_ath_MSEM_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30681" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/price_ath_MSEM_2025.jpeg" alt="Emerging markets index value over time with all-time highs plotted in red." width="700" height="560"></a>

While I would love to definitively conclude that EM stocks are more likely to trend,&nbsp;we must keep in mind that this only covers a few market cycles. When you have only a few observations to go off of, it's difficult to make generalized statements.

Nevertheless, <strong>there is no historical evidence that buying international stocks (Developed or EM) near an all-time high is followed by worse short-term performance. </strong>If anything, there is some evidence that short-term performance may be slightly improved (at least for EM stocks).

Now that we've looked at international stocks, let's turn our attention to two other asset classes that have done quite well this year.
<h2>What About Bitcoin and Gold?</h2>
In 2025 both Bitcoin and gold hit all-time highs and have been the bedrock of <a href="https://taxproject.org/debasement-trade/">the debasement trade</a>. How do these asset classes tend to perform when near all-time highs? Incredibly well, <em>especially</em> over the next year.

Historically, gold returned 37.9% (on average) over the next year when near an all-time high and only 4.1% when off of one (from 1979-2025):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_GOLD_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30670" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_GOLD_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year when near or off an all-time high (for Gold)." width="700" height="560"></a> When gold goes on a run, it really runs over the next year.

You could say the same thing about Bitcoin from 2014-2025:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_BTC_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30671" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_BTC_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year when near or off an all-time high (for Bitcoin)" width="700" height="560"></a>

Bitcoin returned 145.9% (on average) over the next year when near an all-time high compared to only 78.4% when off an all-time high during this period.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, these fantastic returns don't seem to persist over longer periods. When looking at the 3-year timeframes, Bitcoin performs relatively worse when <em>near</em> an all-time high than when off one [23.1% annualized vs. 61.6% annualized]. And gold does roughly the same in either condition [5.0% annualized vs. 4.2% annualized].&nbsp;

Gold in particular has been very susceptible to momentum given how long it tends to stay between all-time highs:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_GOLD_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30672" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_GOLD_2025.jpeg" alt="Days between all-time highs for gold from 1980 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

What does this mean for you as an individual investor?

If you do own gold or Bitcoin, expect these assets to trend for a while and then have extended periods where they aren't making new highs.<strong> However, when gold and Bitcoin do make new highs, this tends to be bullish in the short term.</strong>

Of course, all-time highs are bullish until they aren't. Have gold and Bitcoin's recent runs come to an end? I don't know. Unfortunately, history is the study of everything that's happened <em>so far</em>. It's very possible that this time is different.
<h2>Is This Time Different?</h2>
Though the future is always uncertain, the data presented here should give you some relief when buying assets near all-time highs. <strong>Whether you are investing in U.S. stocks, international stocks, gold, or Bitcoin, the evidence suggests that all-time highs should not alter your regular investment plan</strong>. If anything, they're neutral to slightly bullish in the short term.

But, is this time different?

Trust me, I get it. A few months ago <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-im-bearish-on-us-stocks-for-the-second-time-since-2017/">I explained why I was bearish on U.S. stocks</a> due to some extreme valuations I was seeing in the tech space. I still believe this thesis to be true. I believe AI is overhyped and <a href="https://x.com/GestaltU/status/1954561703967867019">some AI maximalists are starting to believe so as well</a>.

Nevertheless, I haven't stopped buying U.S. stocks. What did I do instead? I rebalanced my 401(k) from 100% risk assets to 80% risk assets + 20% intermediate-term U.S. bonds. It decreased my <em>overall</em> allocation to U.S. stocks by about 1.5%.

That's it. I truly do <a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Sin-a-Little">sin a little</a>. Just enough to satisfy my behavioral urge without risking my financial future.

Of course, I don't know how the AI race is going to end. I don't know if this time is different. But avoiding U.S. stocks entirely because they are at all-time highs would've been a bad strategy to follow.

If you're truly worried, do what I do and sin a little. Then hold your nose and <a href="https://amzn.to/47eK45R"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a>.&nbsp;

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the S&amp;P 500 hitting its 36th all-time high of 2025 last week, many investors are wondering whether now is a good time to buy. After all, wouldn't you get a better price if you waited? Technically, you very likely would. As I stated in <a href="https://amzn.to/47rb2WO"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a>:
<blockquote>If you randomly picked a trading day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1930-2020, there is over a 95% chance that the Dow would close <em>lower</em> on <em>some</em> day in the future.</blockquote>
So while we are <em>likely</em> to see a lower price by waiting, unfortunately, these lower prices are rare (i.e. they only occur on 5% of days). More importantly, these 5% of days can't be identified ahead of time.

But, what about after an all-time high? The analysis above was done across <em>all</em> trading days. If we subset to only all-time highs, would the probability of seeing a lower price in the future change?&nbsp;

To test this, I re-ran this analysis from January 1915 to October 2025 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Across <em>all </em>trading days, the chance that the Dow would close lower on <em>some day</em> in the future was 96.7% (even higher than during 1930-2020 period).

But, if you bought at an all-time high, the probability that you'd see a lower price in the future was 97.0%. It was <em>slightly</em> <em>higher</em> than when the market is not at an all-time high.

While this might seem like evidence that you shouldn't buy at all-time highs, unfortunately, this difference was <em>not</em> statistically significant. The difference between 96.7% and 97.0% seems to be just random chance. <strong>In other words, when you buy at an all-time high you are <em>no more likely</em> to see a future lower price than buying on any other trading day.</strong>

So while buying U.S. stocks at an all-time high doesn't seem to harm us, does it help us?

Historically, not really.

From 1950-2025, the future 1-year returns of the S&amp;P 500 are actually lower when near an all-time high ("Near ATH") than when off an all-time high ("Off ATH") [8.3% vs. 10.1%]. In this case "Near ATH" means anytime the S&amp;P 500 is within 5% of an all-time high, "Off ATH" is all other times:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30664" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the S&amp;P 500)" width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, the 1-year return distributions are similar though the "Off ATH" distribution is shifted slightly to the right (i.e. has better returns).

But if we look over a 3-year return window, this changes. For 3-year future returns, it's better to be near an all-time high than off of one [8.4% annualized vs. 7.8% annualized]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30665" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_SPX_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next 3 years by all-time high status (for the S&amp;P 500)" width="700" height="560"></a>

Because the 1-year and 3-year returns point in opposite directions, this suggests that market timing based on all-time highs doesn't work. In other words, <strong>being near an all-time high doesn't seem to impact future U.S. stock returns in any consistent or meaningful way.</strong>

While there are long stretches where the S&amp;P 500 doesn't hit all-time highs (see below), these periods have been quite rare:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_SPX_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30667" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_SPX_2025.jpeg" alt="Days Between All-Time Highs for the S&amp;P 500 from 1950-2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

But what about other markets? Though the S&amp;P 500 doesn't seem to have any difference in returns when near all-time highs, what about non-U.S. equities? Let's turn to those now.
<h2>What About International Stocks at All-Time Highs?</h2>
When it comes to international stocks, I looked at how the <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/822e3d18-16fb-4d23-9295-11bc9e07b8ba" rel="noopener">MSCI EAFE</a> ("Developed stocks") and <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c0db0a48-01f2-4ba9-ad01-226fd5678111" rel="noopener">MSCI Emerging Markets</a> ("EM stocks") indices performed going back to 1970 and 1989, respectively. Overall the EAFE (Developed stocks) tend to do slightly better when <em>near</em> an all-time high over the next year [9.0% vs 7.2% on average]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30677" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the MSCI EAFE)" width="700" height="560"></a>However, these stocks tend to do slightly <em>worse</em> when near an all-time high over the next three years [5% annualized vs. 6.7% annualized]:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30678" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEAFE_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next three years by all-time high status (for the MSCI EAFE)" width="700" height="560"></a>

This suggests that any momentum for EAFE stocks tends to be short-lived.

<strong>However, this is <em>not&nbsp;</em>the case for Emerging Market stocks, which do about 2x better over both 1-year and 3-year periods when near all-time highs.&nbsp;</strong>Over the next year, EM stocks return 15.6% (on average) when near an all-time high versus only 7.9% when off of one:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30679" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year by all-time high status (for the MSCI Emerging Markets)" width="700" height="560"></a>

And over the next three years, EM stocks return 10.5% (annualized) when near an all-time high versus only 5.1% (annualized) when off of one:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_3yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30680" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_MSEM_3yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next three years by all-time high status (for the MSCI Emerging Markets)" width="700" height="560"></a>

This suggests that momentum plays a bigger role with EM stocks than with U.S. or Developed stocks.

We can see this in the chart below which shows the MSCI Emerging Markets index over time with all-time highs plotted in red. Note how EM stocks seem to have bursts of high returns followed by extended periods of stagnation:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/price_ath_MSEM_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30681" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/price_ath_MSEM_2025.jpeg" alt="Emerging markets index value over time with all-time highs plotted in red." width="700" height="560"></a>

While I would love to definitively conclude that EM stocks are more likely to trend,&nbsp;we must keep in mind that this only covers a few market cycles. When you have only a few observations to go off of, it's difficult to make generalized statements.

Nevertheless, <strong>there is no historical evidence that buying international stocks (Developed or EM) near an all-time high is followed by worse short-term performance. </strong>If anything, there is some evidence that short-term performance may be slightly improved (at least for EM stocks).

Now that we've looked at international stocks, let's turn our attention to two other asset classes that have done quite well this year.
<h2>What About Bitcoin and Gold?</h2>
In 2025 both Bitcoin and gold hit all-time highs and have been the bedrock of <a href="https://taxproject.org/debasement-trade/">the debasement trade</a>. How do these asset classes tend to perform when near all-time highs? Incredibly well, <em>especially</em> over the next year.

Historically, gold returned 37.9% (on average) over the next year when near an all-time high and only 4.1% when off of one (from 1979-2025):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_GOLD_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30670" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_GOLD_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year when near or off an all-time high (for Gold)." width="700" height="560"></a> When gold goes on a run, it really runs over the next year.

You could say the same thing about Bitcoin from 2014-2025:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_BTC_1yr_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30671" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fwd_ret_BTC_1yr_2025.jpeg" alt="Annualized return over the next year when near or off an all-time high (for Bitcoin)" width="700" height="560"></a>

Bitcoin returned 145.9% (on average) over the next year when near an all-time high compared to only 78.4% when off an all-time high during this period.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, these fantastic returns don't seem to persist over longer periods. When looking at the 3-year timeframes, Bitcoin performs relatively worse when <em>near</em> an all-time high than when off one [23.1% annualized vs. 61.6% annualized]. And gold does roughly the same in either condition [5.0% annualized vs. 4.2% annualized].&nbsp;

Gold in particular has been very susceptible to momentum given how long it tends to stay between all-time highs:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_GOLD_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30672" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/days_btwn_ath_GOLD_2025.jpeg" alt="Days between all-time highs for gold from 1980 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

What does this mean for you as an individual investor?

If you do own gold or Bitcoin, expect these assets to trend for a while and then have extended periods where they aren't making new highs.<strong> However, when gold and Bitcoin do make new highs, this tends to be bullish in the short term.</strong>

Of course, all-time highs are bullish until they aren't. Have gold and Bitcoin's recent runs come to an end? I don't know. Unfortunately, history is the study of everything that's happened <em>so far</em>. It's very possible that this time is different.
<h2>Is This Time Different?</h2>
Though the future is always uncertain, the data presented here should give you some relief when buying assets near all-time highs. <strong>Whether you are investing in U.S. stocks, international stocks, gold, or Bitcoin, the evidence suggests that all-time highs should not alter your regular investment plan</strong>. If anything, they're neutral to slightly bullish in the short term.

But, is this time different?

Trust me, I get it. A few months ago <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-im-bearish-on-us-stocks-for-the-second-time-since-2017/">I explained why I was bearish on U.S. stocks</a> due to some extreme valuations I was seeing in the tech space. I still believe this thesis to be true. I believe AI is overhyped and <a href="https://x.com/GestaltU/status/1954561703967867019">some AI maximalists are starting to believe so as well</a>.

Nevertheless, I haven't stopped buying U.S. stocks. What did I do instead? I rebalanced my 401(k) from 100% risk assets to 80% risk assets + 20% intermediate-term U.S. bonds. It decreased my <em>overall</em> allocation to U.S. stocks by about 1.5%.

That's it. I truly do <a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Sin-a-Little">sin a little</a>. Just enough to satisfy my behavioral urge without risking my financial future.

Of course, I don't know how the AI race is going to end. I don't know if this time is different. But avoiding U.S. stocks entirely because they are at all-time highs would've been a bad strategy to follow.

If you're truly worried, do what I do and sin a little. Then hold your nose and <a href="https://amzn.to/47eK45R"><em>Just Keep Buying</em></a>.&nbsp;

Happy investing and thank you for reading!

					<description><![CDATA[For those who have been living under a rock, let's hope it was gold, because the shiny metal is up over 50% year-to-date (YTD) compared with 18% for the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends). With this recent outperformance by gold, some are starting to question whether investing in stocks still makes sense.

For example, I saw a chart like this going viral which compared the growth of $1 invested in gold versus the S&amp;P 500 since January 2000:&nbsp;

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2000_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30482" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2000_2025.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 2000 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, gold has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) by nearly 2x since 2000. After seeing something like this it's easy to question why you would ever own stocks. If a glittering rock can outperform productive businesses, what's the point of owning stocks at all?

While this comparison is <em>technically</em> accurate, it's also quite misleading. Not only were U.S. stocks in the midst of <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/asset-bubble/">their largest bubble ever</a> (during the DotCom boom), but gold was still down over 50% from its highs in the late 1970s. By starting in the year 2000, you are comparing U.S. stocks <em>at their most expensive</em> to gold <em>near its cheapest</em>. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson">Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul</a> comparison of investing. One was out of their prime and the other wasn't.

I can similarly stack the deck <em>against</em> gold by starting the performance comparison in January 2012, as gold reached new all-time highs. If you did so, you would see that the S&amp;P 500 <em>outperformed</em> gold by 2.7x since then:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2012_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30483" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2012_2025.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 2012 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

So which is it? Is investing in gold a better bet than stocks? Or is the yellow ore bound to disappoint?

Truthfully, it's a bit of both. Over long periods of time, U.S. stocks tend to outperform gold. You can see this in the chart below which shows the growth of $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 versus gold since 1990:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_1990_2025-1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30505" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_1990_2025-1.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 1990 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

That's a 4x difference in return over the last 35 years.

However, there are also periods where gold absolutely crushes U.S. stocks. The 1970s were one such period. During this decade, gold was up 1,365% while U.S. stocks only ended up 76% (from <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/10/why-i-dont-own-any-gold/">Ben Carlson's recent post</a> on why he doesn't own any gold):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carlson_gold_vs_sp500_1970s.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30507" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carlson_gold_vs_sp500_1970s.png" alt="Gold vs S&amp;P 500 in the 1970s (by Ben Carlson)" width="700" height="394"></a>

Can you imagine <em>not</em> owning gold when this happened? It would've been one of the most FOMO-inducing moments in investment history.

This is one of the reasons why gold remains popular as an asset class. Though it usually underperforms, it has rare moments where it triumphs. And in these triumphs it can be quite effective in a diversified portfolio.

But what's happening with gold today? It's outperforming, yet U.S. stocks aren't struggling. The investment environment is nothing like the 1970s or 2000s, so what's going on? Warren Pies <a href="https://x.com/WarrenPies/status/1949070662506545544">summarized the sentiment shift</a> perfectly a few months ago:
<blockquote>The fear of losing ground (i.e., purchasing power) is replacing the fear of losing principal.</blockquote>
Investors have a lot of anxiety around the stability of the U.S. dollar with soaring debt levels, an ongoing trade war, and the threat of continued inflation. These fears aren't unfounded either. The <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/">U.S. deficit is tracking about the same as in 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">CPI has also increased</a> from 2.3% in May to 2.9% in August. With the possible loss of purchasing power for the U.S. dollar, investors are piling into assets that are typically thought to be inflation hedges (e.g. gold, silver, etc.).

And when I say "piling in," I mean it. As <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-etfs-holdings-and-flows/2025/10">the World Gold Council reported</a>:
<blockquote>Global physically backed gold ETFs recorded their largest monthly inflow in September, resulting in the strongest quarter on record.</blockquote>
But demand isn't just coming from retail investors, it's coming from central banks too. Due to recent buying activity, foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries for the first time since 1996 (h/t <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rise-central-bank-reserves-appears-unstoppable-2025-09-04/">Reuters</a>):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_vs_ust_foreign_central_banks.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30540" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_vs_ust_foreign_central_banks.jpg" alt="Foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries." width="700" height="468"></a>

More importantly, gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset after the U.S. dollar.

Here's the ironic part though—investors are buying into gold <em>partially</em> as an inflation hedge, but it's never been a great inflation hedge. <strong>Historically, every time inflation has been above 4%, the best assets to own were REITs and equities, not gold.</strong> The table below illustrates this by showing the median real return (when inflation exceeded 4%) by asset class from 1972-2021:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asset_class_real_bv_cpi_4pct.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-24171 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asset_class_real_bv_cpi_4pct.png" alt="" width="383" height="240"></a>

Gold had a -1.4% real return during these inflationary periods. And during our most recent bout of inflation in 2022, gold was flat as well.

Yes, gold did go up 33% from January 2020 to August 2020, but it didn't do much afterwards, as inflation skyrocketed. The chart below shows this initial price increase followed by a longer whipsaw (during the <em>actual</em> inflationary period):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_price_2020_to_2023.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30516" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_price_2020_to_2023.png" alt="Gold price change from January 2020 to December 2023" width="700" height="463"></a>

While investors are certainly forward-looking, do you think they anticipated <em>all</em> of the inflation from 2021-2022 and bid up gold's price accordingly by August 2020? Call me skeptical.

Either way, gold is rising because more people are buying than selling. Whether they are buying because of a weakening dollar, geopolitical uncertainty, possible future inflation, or some mix of these factors is up for debate.

Is this confluence of factors pushing gold into bubble territory? I don't know. But I do know that, historically, gold tends to move in fits and starts. It goes on great runs and then has decades with nothing to show for it. Not everyone can handle these lost decades. I'm not even sure I can, and I have a small allocation (3%) myself.

I have a long love-hate relationship with gold. I invested in it many years ago, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/know-thy-investing-self/">publicly abandoned it in 2017</a> after examining the data. Those multi-decade drawdowns were a no-go for me.

But, as it started to rise in 2024, I looked at the data again and realized that I was missing the forest for the trees. Yes, gold performs poorly as an <em>individual</em> asset class, but its diversification benefits <em>within a portfolio</em> are hard to argue against. As <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/identify-opportunities-gold-among-japanese-insurers-market-study/gold-offers-portfolio-diversification-benefits">the World Gold Council noted</a>:
<blockquote>Our analysis shows that gold has consistently lowered the overall volatility portfolios: on average, the Sharpe ratio increases by 12% when 2.5% of the portfolio is composed of gold, demonstrating a unique diversification effect unparalleled by any other asset.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/insights-investment-ideas/spdr-invest-in-gold.pdf">StateStreet did an analysis from 2005-2025</a> which found that adding a small gold allocation (from 2% to 10%) to a global multi-asset market portfolio <em>increased</em> the return while <em>decreasing</em> the volatility and maximum drawdown:

As much as I hate to admit it, a little gold can go a long way. So,&nbsp;I added a small (almost trivial) position and moved on.

That decision has worked out well, mostly due to dumb luck. It's easy to hold onto something while it's going up. But when gold inevitably declines and has a long stretch of lackluster performance, then come talk to me. I won't be as cheerful, but I'll try to hold anyways.

Until then, happy investing and thank you for reading.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those who have been living under a rock, let's hope it was gold, because the shiny metal is up over 50% year-to-date (YTD) compared with 18% for the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends). With this recent outperformance by gold, some are starting to question whether investing in stocks still makes sense.

For example, I saw a chart like this going viral which compared the growth of $1 invested in gold versus the S&amp;P 500 since January 2000:&nbsp;

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2000_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30482" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2000_2025.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 2000 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, gold has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) by nearly 2x since 2000. After seeing something like this it's easy to question why you would ever own stocks. If a glittering rock can outperform productive businesses, what's the point of owning stocks at all?

While this comparison is <em>technically</em> accurate, it's also quite misleading. Not only were U.S. stocks in the midst of <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/asset-bubble/">their largest bubble ever</a> (during the DotCom boom), but gold was still down over 50% from its highs in the late 1970s. By starting in the year 2000, you are comparing U.S. stocks <em>at their most expensive</em> to gold <em>near its cheapest</em>. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson">Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul</a> comparison of investing. One was out of their prime and the other wasn't.

I can similarly stack the deck <em>against</em> gold by starting the performance comparison in January 2012, as gold reached new all-time highs. If you did so, you would see that the S&amp;P 500 <em>outperformed</em> gold by 2.7x since then:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2012_2025.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30483" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_2012_2025.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 2012 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

So which is it? Is investing in gold a better bet than stocks? Or is the yellow ore bound to disappoint?

Truthfully, it's a bit of both. Over long periods of time, U.S. stocks tend to outperform gold. You can see this in the chart below which shows the growth of $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 versus gold since 1990:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_1990_2025-1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30505" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/spxtr_v_gld_1990_2025-1.jpeg" alt="Growth of $1 invested in Gold versus the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends) from 1990 to 2025." width="700" height="560"></a>

That's a 4x difference in return over the last 35 years.

However, there are also periods where gold absolutely crushes U.S. stocks. The 1970s were one such period. During this decade, gold was up 1,365% while U.S. stocks only ended up 76% (from <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/10/why-i-dont-own-any-gold/">Ben Carlson's recent post</a> on why he doesn't own any gold):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carlson_gold_vs_sp500_1970s.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30507" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carlson_gold_vs_sp500_1970s.png" alt="Gold vs S&amp;P 500 in the 1970s (by Ben Carlson)" width="700" height="394"></a>

Can you imagine <em>not</em> owning gold when this happened? It would've been one of the most FOMO-inducing moments in investment history.

This is one of the reasons why gold remains popular as an asset class. Though it usually underperforms, it has rare moments where it triumphs. And in these triumphs it can be quite effective in a diversified portfolio.

But what's happening with gold today? It's outperforming, yet U.S. stocks aren't struggling. The investment environment is nothing like the 1970s or 2000s, so what's going on? Warren Pies <a href="https://x.com/WarrenPies/status/1949070662506545544">summarized the sentiment shift</a> perfectly a few months ago:
<blockquote>The fear of losing ground (i.e., purchasing power) is replacing the fear of losing principal.</blockquote>
Investors have a lot of anxiety around the stability of the U.S. dollar with soaring debt levels, an ongoing trade war, and the threat of continued inflation. These fears aren't unfounded either. The <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/">U.S. deficit is tracking about the same as in 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">CPI has also increased</a> from 2.3% in May to 2.9% in August. With the possible loss of purchasing power for the U.S. dollar, investors are piling into assets that are typically thought to be inflation hedges (e.g. gold, silver, etc.).

And when I say "piling in," I mean it. As <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-etfs-holdings-and-flows/2025/10">the World Gold Council reported</a>:
<blockquote>Global physically backed gold ETFs recorded their largest monthly inflow in September, resulting in the strongest quarter on record.</blockquote>
But demand isn't just coming from retail investors, it's coming from central banks too. Due to recent buying activity, foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries for the first time since 1996 (h/t <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/golds-rise-central-bank-reserves-appears-unstoppable-2025-09-04/">Reuters</a>):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_vs_ust_foreign_central_banks.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30540" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_vs_ust_foreign_central_banks.jpg" alt="Foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries." width="700" height="468"></a>

More importantly, gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset after the U.S. dollar.

Here's the ironic part though—investors are buying into gold <em>partially</em> as an inflation hedge, but it's never been a great inflation hedge. <strong>Historically, every time inflation has been above 4%, the best assets to own were REITs and equities, not gold.</strong> The table below illustrates this by showing the median real return (when inflation exceeded 4%) by asset class from 1972-2021:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asset_class_real_bv_cpi_4pct.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-24171 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asset_class_real_bv_cpi_4pct.png" alt="" width="383" height="240"></a>

Gold had a -1.4% real return during these inflationary periods. And during our most recent bout of inflation in 2022, gold was flat as well.

Yes, gold did go up 33% from January 2020 to August 2020, but it didn't do much afterwards, as inflation skyrocketed. The chart below shows this initial price increase followed by a longer whipsaw (during the <em>actual</em> inflationary period):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_price_2020_to_2023.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30516" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold_price_2020_to_2023.png" alt="Gold price change from January 2020 to December 2023" width="700" height="463"></a>

While investors are certainly forward-looking, do you think they anticipated <em>all</em> of the inflation from 2021-2022 and bid up gold's price accordingly by August 2020? Call me skeptical.

Either way, gold is rising because more people are buying than selling. Whether they are buying because of a weakening dollar, geopolitical uncertainty, possible future inflation, or some mix of these factors is up for debate.

Is this confluence of factors pushing gold into bubble territory? I don't know. But I do know that, historically, gold tends to move in fits and starts. It goes on great runs and then has decades with nothing to show for it. Not everyone can handle these lost decades. I'm not even sure I can, and I have a small allocation (3%) myself.

I have a long love-hate relationship with gold. I invested in it many years ago, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/know-thy-investing-self/">publicly abandoned it in 2017</a> after examining the data. Those multi-decade drawdowns were a no-go for me.

But, as it started to rise in 2024, I looked at the data again and realized that I was missing the forest for the trees. Yes, gold performs poorly as an <em>individual</em> asset class, but its diversification benefits <em>within a portfolio</em> are hard to argue against. As <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/identify-opportunities-gold-among-japanese-insurers-market-study/gold-offers-portfolio-diversification-benefits">the World Gold Council noted</a>:
<blockquote>Our analysis shows that gold has consistently lowered the overall volatility portfolios: on average, the Sharpe ratio increases by 12% when 2.5% of the portfolio is composed of gold, demonstrating a unique diversification effect unparalleled by any other asset.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/insights-investment-ideas/spdr-invest-in-gold.pdf">StateStreet did an analysis from 2005-2025</a> which found that adding a small gold allocation (from 2% to 10%) to a global multi-asset market portfolio <em>increased</em> the return while <em>decreasing</em> the volatility and maximum drawdown:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ssga_gold_2_to_10_allocation_results.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30570" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ssga_gold_2_to_10_allocation_results.png" alt="StateStreet adding gold to a global multi-asset portfolio results from 2005 to 2025." width="700" height="307"></a>

					<description><![CDATA[If you're a Millennial (like me), you've probably felt both richer and poorer at the same time. You're likely <em>ahead</em> of where your parents were financially at your age, but <em>behind</em> them on other life milestones, such as owning a home or having children.

Last week I was part of a panel hosted by The Manhattan Institute titled <a href="https://manhattan.institute/event/are-millennials-doomed-stagnation-success-and-the-politics-of-a-divided-generation"><em>Are Millennials Doomed? Stagnation, Success, and the Politics of a Divided Generation</em></a>. A wide variety of cultural and political topics were covered during the discussion, but I want to dig deeper on the financial ones and why this feeling of "richer yet poorer" persists.

While money isn't the only thing that impacts Millennials, it influences where they live, where they work, and what policies they support. And since Millennials are the largest generational cohort in America today, those decisions may impact how <em>you</em> live as well.

To start, let's examine Millennial wealth and how being the richest generation for their age in history doesn't solve all of their problems.
<h2>Absolutely Wealthy, Relatively Less So</h2>
In absolute terms, Millennials have more inflation-adjusted wealth for their age than any prior generation. You can see this in the chart below which shows the 90th, 75th, and 50th (median) inflation-adjusted net worth for households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022/2023 (the latest data available). Households age 26-41 in 2022 correspond with individuals born from 1981-1996 (aka Millennials). By holding this age group constant over time, we can compare Millennials in 2022 to <em>similarly-aged cohorts</em> in the past:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30448" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted net worth of the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, Millennials in 2022 had more inflation-adjusted wealth than prior generations going back to 1989.

More importantly, this pattern held across <em>most</em> of the wealth spectrum. You can see this in the chart below (similar to the one above), which shows the 15th, 25th, and 50th percentile net worth over time for households age 26-41:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_15_50_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30449" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_15_50_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted net worth of the 15th, 25th, and 50th percentile households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

All the way down to the 15th percentile, Millennials had roughly the same (or more) wealth than prior generations at the same age. It's only Millennials <em>below</em> the 15th percentile that have less wealth than prior generations. These are the households that are struggling the most in the Millennial cohort and could definitely use some sort of help.

Why are they struggling? Higher debt loads (mostly from student loans) and incomes that aren't keeping up with housing costs. The chart below illustrates that Millennials have much higher <em>non-home</em> debt (e.g., student loans, credit card debt, etc.) than prior generations. This is especially true near the extremes (i.e. 90th percentile):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_nhd_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30453" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_nhd_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted non-home debt by year for households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

Though non-home debt has come down somewhat in recent years, this is <em>after </em>rising consistently for the past three decades.&nbsp;

Outside of non-home debt, Millennials are also spending a bit more of their income on rent as well. As you can see, the <em>rent-to-income </em>ratio for households age 26-41 was at the highest recorded in 2022:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_rti_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30499" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_rti_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted rent-to-income by year for households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

So, while Millennials are generally wealthier than prior generations, there are other factors that are holding some of them back.

More importantly, having more <em>absolute</em> wealth doesn't always mean that you're better off. <em>Relative</em> wealth matters too. Despite being the largest generational cohort in America today, Millennials only own 10.7% of all wealth as of Q2 2025, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:143;series:Net%20worth;demographic:generation;population:all;units:shares">according to the Federal Reserve</a>:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed_wealth_by_generation_2025_q2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30417" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed_wealth_by_generation_2025_q2.png" alt="Wealth by generation from 2010 to Q2 2025 from the Federal Reserve." width="700" height="467"></a>

This is partially to be expected, since wealth is highly correlated with age (due to years of additional work, saving, and investing).&nbsp;

However, Boomers still control ~5x more capital than Millennials. Such a financial power imbalance will impact competitive dynamics for scarce resources such as housing. This partially explains why the median age of first-time home buyers is 38 and for all homebuyers is 56 (both at record highs):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/median_age_homebuyers_2025.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-30459 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/median_age_homebuyers_2025.jpeg" alt="Median age of homeowners (first time buyers and all homeowners) over time." width="700" height="525"></a>

<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/boom-and-bust-millennials-arent-all-worse-off-than-baby-boomers-but-the-rich-poor-gap-is-widening">According to the University of Cambridge</a>, 62% of Boomers owned homes at 35, while only 49% of Millennials did. Some of this is due to different <em>lifestyle choices</em> made by Millennials. Settling down later in life or <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/its-the-housing-stupid/">renting by choice</a> are both impacting these statistics. However, having 1/5th of the capital of a typical Boomer doesn't help either.

So, how can Millennials fix these problems? I see three paths forward.
<h2>The Three Paths Forward for Millennials</h2>
When it comes to improving their financial future, there are three paths that Millennials can choose from: reform, exit, and development.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reform</strong>: Reform is the process of campaigning for and enacting policy changes that would benefit Millennials. Such reforms include: reducing zoning restrictions (to increase housing supply), enacting stronger term/age limits for political leaders, and forgiving student loan debt (which weighs down a subset of Millennials). Whether or not you support any of these policies isn't relevant, the main idea here is that Millennials would voice their opinions and enact change to improve their situation. Reform works by making modifications to the existing system through legal channels.</li>
 	<li><strong>Exit</strong>: Exit is the process of abandoning the existing system and building a new one that better suits a group's needs. Politically, the rise of Democratic Socialism among Millennials and Gen Zers (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohran_Mamdani">Zohranism</a>) can be seen as a form of exit. Financially, cryptocurrency is an exit from the traditional financial system. Whether or not you agree with exit as a philosophy, it's always an option for those dissatisfied with the status quo.
<ul>
 	<li>If you want to learn more about exit, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">this talk by Balaji Srinivasan</a> from 2013.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Development</strong>: Development is the process of ignoring the system altogether and focusing on how you can improve your own life. Instead of asking about the system, it asks you about yourself. What can you do to improve in the coming months and years? Can you learn new skills? Can you deepen your relationships? Can you better your health? Whatever it is, development is focused on things that you can <em>directly</em> control. Of all the ways that individual Millennials can try to improve their lives, development seems to be the one with the highest probability of success.</li>
</ul>
In full, you can fix the existing system (reform), find a new system (exit), or ignore the system altogether and focus on yourself (development). While there are pros and cons to each of these approaches, I have a strong preference for development. The reasoning is simple—one person is unlikely to make a difference when reforming a system or exiting to a new one.

However, your actions <em>will</em> have an undeniable impact on your own life. How you spend your time, money, energy, and effort will likely make a much bigger difference than any policy or system ever could. Don't get me wrong, I support the political process and think we <em>should</em> try to make changes where we want them.

Yet, politics is hard and things don't always work out in your favor. You can't control elections. You can't control other people. But you can improve your own life. That option is (and will always be) on the table.

I don't believe that Millennials are doomed. Much of what we see today is, unfortunately, just a timing problem. More wealth will be passed on in the coming years and decades.

Some of this is already happening. As I've noted before, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/millennial-gen-z-adult-children-parents-monthly-payments-retirement/">50% of parents are financially supporting their Gen Z and Millennial children</a> to the tune of about $1,500 a month. This isn't helpful for the 50% of Millennials that are&nbsp;<em>not</em> getting financial support, but it is what it is.

I don't know what the future holds for Millennials. I don't know if they're "doomed." But I do know that those who focus on developing themselves unequivocally won't be.&nbsp;

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30448" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted net worth of the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

As you can see, Millennials in 2022 had more inflation-adjusted wealth than prior generations going back to 1989.

More importantly, this pattern held across <em>most</em> of the wealth spectrum. You can see this in the chart below (similar to the one above), which shows the 15th, 25th, and 50th percentile net worth over time for households age 26-41:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_15_50_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30449" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_net_worth_by_year_15_50_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted net worth of the 15th, 25th, and 50th percentile households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

All the way down to the 15th percentile, Millennials had roughly the same (or more) wealth than prior generations at the same age. It's only Millennials <em>below</em> the 15th percentile that have less wealth than prior generations. These are the households that are struggling the most in the Millennial cohort and could definitely use some sort of help.

Why are they struggling? Higher debt loads (mostly from student loans) and incomes that aren't keeping up with housing costs. The chart below illustrates that Millennials have much higher <em>non-home</em> debt (e.g., student loans, credit card debt, etc.) than prior generations. This is especially true near the extremes (i.e. 90th percentile):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_nhd_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30453" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_nhd_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted non-home debt by year for households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

Though non-home debt has come down somewhat in recent years, this is <em>after </em>rising consistently for the past three decades.&nbsp;

Outside of non-home debt, Millennials are also spending a bit more of their income on rent as well. As you can see, the <em>rent-to-income </em>ratio for households age 26-41 was at the highest recorded in 2022:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_rti_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30499" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/millennial_cohort_rti_by_year_50_90_2022.jpeg" alt="Inflation-adjusted rent-to-income by year for households age 26-41 from 1989 to 2022." width="700" height="560"></a>

So, while Millennials are generally wealthier than prior generations, there are other factors that are holding some of them back.

More importantly, having more <em>absolute</em> wealth doesn't always mean that you're better off. <em>Relative</em> wealth matters too. Despite being the largest generational cohort in America today, Millennials only own 10.7% of all wealth as of Q2 2025, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:143;series:Net%20worth;demographic:generation;population:all;units:shares">according to the Federal Reserve</a>:

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed_wealth_by_generation_2025_q2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30417" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed_wealth_by_generation_2025_q2.png" alt="Wealth by generation from 2010 to Q2 2025 from the Federal Reserve." width="700" height="467"></a>

This is partially to be expected, since wealth is highly correlated with age (due to years of additional work, saving, and investing).&nbsp;

However, Boomers still control ~5x more capital than Millennials. Such a financial power imbalance will impact competitive dynamics for scarce resources such as housing. This partially explains why the median age of first-time home buyers is 38 and for all homebuyers is 56 (both at record highs):

<a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/median_age_homebuyers_2025.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-30459 aligncenter" src="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/median_age_homebuyers_2025.jpeg" alt="Median age of homeowners (first time buyers and all homeowners) over time." width="700" height="525"></a>

<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/boom-and-bust-millennials-arent-all-worse-off-than-baby-boomers-but-the-rich-poor-gap-is-widening">According to the University of Cambridge</a>, 62% of Boomers owned homes at 35, while only 49% of Millennials did. Some of this is due to different <em>lifestyle choices</em> made by Millennials. Settling down later in life or <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/its-the-housing-stupid/">renting by choice</a> are both impacting these statistics. However, having 1/5th of the capital of a typical Boomer doesn't help either.

So, how can Millennials fix these problems? I see three paths forward.
<h2>The Three Paths Forward for Millennials</h2>
When it comes to improving their financial future, there are three paths that Millennials can choose from: reform, exit, and development.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reform</strong>: Reform is the process of campaigning for and enacting policy changes that would benefit Millennials. Such reforms include: reducing zoning restrictions (to increase housing supply), enacting stronger term/age limits for political leaders, and forgiving student loan debt (which weighs down a subset of Millennials). Whether or not you support any of these policies isn't relevant, the main idea here is that Millennials would voice their opinions and enact change to improve their situation. Reform works by making modifications to the existing system through legal channels.</li>
 	<li><strong>Exit</strong>: Exit is the process of abandoning the existing system and building a new one that better suits a group's needs. Politically, the rise of Democratic Socialism among Millennials and Gen Zers (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohran_Mamdani">Zohranism</a>) can be seen as a form of exit. Financially, cryptocurrency is an exit from the traditional financial system. Whether or not you agree with exit as a philosophy, it's always an option for those dissatisfied with the status quo.
<ul>
 	<li>If you want to learn more about exit, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">this talk by Balaji Srinivasan</a> from 2013.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Development</strong>: Development is the process of ignoring the system altogether and focusing on how you can improve your own life. Instead of asking about the system, it asks you about yourself. What can you do to improve in the coming months and years? Can you learn new skills? Can you deepen your relationships? Can you better your health? Whatever it is, development is focused on things that you can <em>directly</em> control. Of all the ways that individual Millennials can try to improve their lives, development seems to be the one with the highest probability of success.</li>
</ul>
In full, you can fix the existing system (reform), find a new system (exit), or ignore the system altogether and focus on yourself (development). While there are pros and cons to each of these approaches, I have a strong preference for development. The reasoning is simple—one person is unlikely to make a difference when reforming a system or exiting to a new one.

However, your actions <em>will</em> have an undeniable impact on your own life. How you spend your time, money, energy, and effort will likely make a much bigger difference than any policy or system ever could. Don't get me wrong, I support the political process and think we <em>should</em> try to make changes where we want them.

Yet, politics is hard and things don't always work out in your favor. You can't control elections. You can't control other people. But you can improve your own life. That option is (and will always be) on the table.

I don't believe that Millennials are doomed. Much of what we see today is, unfortunately, just a timing problem. More wealth will be passed on in the coming years and decades.

Some of this is already happening. As I've noted before, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/millennial-gen-z-adult-children-parents-monthly-payments-retirement/">50% of parents are financially supporting their Gen Z and Millennial children</a> to the tune of about $1,500 a month. This isn't helpful for the 50% of Millennials that are&nbsp;<em>not</em> getting financial support, but it is what it is.

I don't know what the future holds for Millennials. I don't know if they're "doomed." But I do know that those who focus on developing themselves unequivocally won't be.&nbsp;

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past few months I've attended a few author dinners in NYC. This is where a group of authors/prospective authors get together and discuss whatever is concerning them. There might be a debate around the future of writing and the impact of AI. We might argue about traditional publishing versus self-publishing. And so forth.

Almost all of the authors/prospective authors aren't in the personal finance space, and they tend to be older and far more successful than I am. I don't say this to downplay anything I've done, but to emphasize that there's a difference between selling thousands of books and selling millions.

The thing that really surprises me though is how they think about money. At some point during the conversation, the discussion inevitably turns to personal finance. And when it does, it's always an eye-opener.

For example, one online creator complained about the price of beer at their local brewery. It was $15 after tax and tip. I get it. A beer should <em>feel</em> cheaper than $15, even at a craft brewery. But this complaint is coming from someone who posts about the millions they've made online.

While I don't know their exact financial situation, based on their public earnings alone they are either <a href="https://amzn.to/4h3AVAu">deep in Level 4 ($1M-$10M)</a> or low Level 5 ($10M-$100M) in their early 40s. This would put them in the top 1% of U.S. households for their age, yet they are complaining about paying $5 extra for a beer.

Their cognitive dissonance is one of the most fascinating things in the world to me. How can you be so wealthy and care about something so insignificant to your finances? You're complaining about the beer, yet you can buy the brewery.

You might argue that such complaints are just performative or are used as a way to connect, but I don't think that's the case. Such spending gripes typically occur <em>unprompted</em> and are always about <em>individual expenses,</em> not the price level in general or how these prices could impact others.

But spending issues are just the tip of the iceberg. I also get a sense of financial insecurity from some of these people who should have nothing to worry about. People in Level 5 ($10M-$100M) who are concerned about the success of their next project. People in the 1% who still seem dissatisfied. And if <em>they</em> are dissatisfied, then how should <em>I</em> feel? It reminds me of that Chris Rock joke:
<blockquote>If Bill Gates woke up with Oprah’s money, he’d jump out the window.</blockquote>
Would you be content as Oprah in this scenario? I would. However, some people wouldn't. The core issue is that wealth is almost always judged on a relative basis, even when it shouldn't be. Alain de Botton summarized this beautifully in <a href="https://amzn.to/42E9reF"><em>Status Anxiety</em></a>:
<blockquote>Wealth is not an absolute. It is relative to desire. Every time we yearn for something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, whatever our resources. And every time we feel satisfied with what we have, we can be counted as rich, however little we may actually possess.</blockquote>
The bigger problem is when people yearn for things that <em>they imagine</em> they need. They can then justify their behavior to acquire more money, even when that won't ultimately solve their problems. The more successful people I've met, the more I've realized this to be true. Financial security isn't what they're chasing (even if they say otherwise). It's something deeper.

Where does it come from? I'm not sure, but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebudgetnista/">Tiffany "The Budgetnista" Aliche</a> once said, "Ambition is a trauma response." Her argument was that many of the most successful people weren't driven by money, but as a reaction to something that happened in their past. While this isn't true for every ambitious person, there are plenty of examples where it holds.

Michael Jordan was known for being driven by insults from his competitors, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wfj3-AjEjQc">to the point of making them up</a>. Lady Gaga used the pain of sexual assault and being bullied in school to fuel her music. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985 and built NeXT, which was acquired by Apple in 1996, eventually leading to Apple's resurgence.

There's a drive inside many successful people that goes beyond money and logic. People who keep going at 100 miles per hour even when they don't need to. More partnerships. More deals. More speaking gigs. More books. It seems never-ending.

Money is a convenient excuse for such behavior because who would say no to more money? But it's not the real reason.&nbsp;

I raise these issues not to judge my fellow authors, but to illustrate the very human side of money, the behavioral side of money. Though I can look at money in this cold, calculating fashion (given how much time I've spent studying it), I know others can't. They experience sticker shock regardless of what's in their bank account. They can feel insecure no matter what my financial calculator tells them.

Similarly, I know that I behave in certain ways that experts in other domains would think are bizarre. I probably "complain about $15 beers" with regards to my health, relationships, and career all the time without realizing it.

Nevertheless, I know that it takes more than numbers to help people <em>feel</em> differently about their money. I can show you <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-the-5-rule-is-the-new-4-rule/">why you can use the 5% Rule</a> or <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum/">why you should make a lump sum investment</a>, but I know that you probably won't follow either.

Despite my bias toward data, the solutions to some of your money problems won't be found in a spreadsheet. I know this, but it's still hard to ignore the numbers. Because there's a disconnect between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibecession">what's going on in the world and how we feel about it</a>. We are living through the richest period in human history, but you'd never know it by talking to many of us. We have all the money and none of the satisfaction.
